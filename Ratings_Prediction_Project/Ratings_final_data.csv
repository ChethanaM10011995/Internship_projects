0,0,"(After using for more than a month) Not satisfied with the screen quality but performance is good..
Definitely it can be first laptop for a beginner.",4
1,1,Good laptop,4
2,2,It is my first laptop so i can not touch much about feartures but it a good laptop and it is working vry well.,4
3,3,"Even if we watch video for 720p for 30 minutes.. it starts heating ..
I saw my processor gone upto 95 degree temp

It's all parts are good .. but fan is worst..

Due to which we can just run heavy programs for half hours max..",3
4,4,"The laptop is good at 30,000 price. finally good laptop for study and multi tasking",4
5,5,You can buy this laptop for gaming gta 5 : 40+ fps in 8gb ram.,4
6,6,Overall laptop is best in 31000 rs but Amazon delivery service is worst,4
7,7,"Likes:
1. Excellent boot up time with new NVME SSD. Measured it, just took 5.8s. ASUS claims that there is additional 2.5‚Äù SSD slot which is empty, but I haven‚Äôt verified it
2. Free upgrade to Windows 11 (some people don‚Äôt like Windows 11, but I wholeheartedly took the free upgrade)
3. Bundled with MS Office 2019 Home & Student. What more a student would require?
4. Full HD crisp screen resolution. Great for viewing at 125% scale.
5. Great keyboard and buttery smooth trackpad with in-built Fingerprint scanner.
6. Lovely grey color

Dislikes:
1. Horrible camera quality. Definitely recommend an additional Logitech webcam
2. Not for Gaming. AMD graphics is good only for light gaming.
3. Fan noise audible, but I have it on an external laptop fan table. So tolerated.",4
8,8,It is good for work and stock market especially your a intraday trader and if we tal about gaming it is ok for games like gta 5 you can play gta 5 in it with smooth gameplay and you can run gta in 60fps with nice graphics you can play but games like rdr it's not ok if your just looking for a standard and work from home or office you don't want to buy this you can buy a good laptop for work at cheaper than this but if your a student and you want a gaming and studies laptop you can buy it but it's storage is only 236 gb and tha system takes 51 gb space you have only 185 gb of storage,3
9,9,Screen quality is not ok and speed is very slow camera quality is poor. It's a standard product,4
10,10,"I can't install Windows 11 what's the problem please check it .
Amd software is showing to me you have launched is not compatible with your currently install graphics drive. Factory reset recommended for this software .
Plz solve .
Other wise I am returning your product",3
11,11,"Fairly fast, boot up speed is really fast, apps opening and switching in between tabs is also very zippy.
Battery life is average at best.
Screen could have been more colourful and viewing angles are not much great.
Build quality feels mediocre. Lot of room for improvement. We can actually feel plasticity nature of laptop.
Internet and Bluetooth etc work flawlessly, u will actually feel good with it's fast fluidic nature.
Overall value for money.",4
12,12,"Tested for the following and they are all working fine.
1. Web Browsing
2. Word, Excel, Powerpoint
3. Coding with IDEs Eclipse, Netbeans, etc
4. Setup of WSL
5. Media consumption

Pros:
1. Boot time is just 10seconds with Windows 10 and is the same after upgrading to Windows 11.
2. Free Office Student is also good.
3. RAM is upgradable.
4. Can attach 2.5inch internal SSD/HDD to expand storage.
5. Display quality is also good.
6. Light weight. Easy to carry daily.

Cons:
1. The product is fine for 2022 standards. It will be slow in the next 4-5years.
2. RAM can be expanded up to 12GB only. Upgradability up to 16GB should have been good.
3. SSD/HDD upgradability needs a connector which is not provided. Shouldn't expect this at this price point as well.

All and all it is a good at the current price range and in the current situation.",5
13,13,"I like this if you are going to purchase a new budget for online classes or commercial purposes Go for it. You can play soft games as well.
cons Worst camera and no card reader slot also viewing angles are not good.
But I'm using it for online classes battery backup very good. üòä

I didn't got the micro sd card port in my product I don't know why because in specifications there are but didn't got it .",4
17,17,"This laptop is actually good. It's fast due to AMD processor and SSD. Don't wanna include RAM cuz it says 8GB rab but usable is only 5.96GB. very disappointed about this and pls don't ask about the camera. It's the worst. Rest everything is good. Light weight, good battery life, good display but I seriously don't understand y camera is so poor. I recommend to connect ur phone rather than using the inbuilt cam",3
18,18,"At this price point, this is one of the best laptops. Performance is faster, lightweight, and also looks great. I have another laptop with the same screen size. Because of the comparatively smaller bezels on this laptop, this looks very small. Impressed with the performance. No lagging. I am usually not a fan of Windows but I am not feeling any slowness (may be because of the faster SSD) on this laptop so I am kind of liking it. üòÅ Also it provides a decent battery backup and performs well even if it is not plugged in.",5
19,19,"Screen quality somewhat okay but sound quality is poor, the speakers should have been much more better. Body of the laptop has made up with low quality of plastic. Performance is average and it may be good for online classes and general purpose.",3

30,30,"I bought this on 5/Dec/2021. Been a laptop user for ages. On the Amazon portal the specs looked great and seems to fit for basic needs. Upon trying it out I found that the two major issues with the laptop that outweighs certain plus.
1) Very Poor Screen Quality. Does not meet the needs of even basic users. Colors fade even if you tilt by 5-10 Degree. Nothing to say about contrast as I could not feel it at all. Brightness adjustment is there. But nothing much can be done. It claims to be 220 Nits screen. Does not seems to be really so.
2) Webcam quality is horrible. It is like having a VGA camera from old Nokia cell phone
Main reason for me to chose the laptop were 14‚Äù size, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD. I took screen quality and Camera for granted as I though a Company like Asus will not falter there. But, it is a worst product. Don‚Äôt go for it.",1

50,0,This is my first 1+ mobile but frankly this is not the worthy which I think. Battery also running very fast and camera quality is also not much better. Overall the performance is below average and definitely you will regret after buy this. You can get much better Mobile even at the cheaper price than this one. At the end personally I have not recommend anyone to buy this Mobile.,4
51,1,"after 4 months of usage, the mobile is very good in terms of stability and managing tasks. but the battery life is not great, using 60HZ refresh rate and all features optimized for the best battery life, The mobile still lasts for only 16-18hrs based on the usage. I am not much of a gamer, and I don't play games much on my mobile. and coming to the camera, comparing it with the rivals this mobile's camera could be a bit better.",4
52,2,"I was searching a smartphone in 25-30k segment checked lot of phones but could not find a good phone with on screen FPS and dedicated sim/MC slot suddenly I checked on google that 1+ is also launching the phones with these features and then I watched an unboxing video and decided to buy this phone the brightness of the display and battery should be more good so it will be definitely more awesome but as per performance and brand of 1+ phone is good in 23000 (including cards discount) the antutu is about to 5lac when the antutu of iphone 12 (Rs 42k cost) is 6.25 lac so this deal is not bad, but if you are planing to buy so just check the phone at the showroom or on ytube.",4
53,3,"Bought in big billion day sale but towards the end. My experience is when Amazon takes time in delivering a product, it will be worth it because they push bad product line in starting and immediate delivery. Gifted my mother (58years), and for an elderly person, this phone is perfect.
I was initially confused whether to buy this then went for it after reading reviews that its good for elderly person.
I setup the phone before giving to my mother. And I am using oneplus6t constantly since may 2019. So oneplus nord ce 2 lite felt like a power in hand. Super fluid, battery, camera, features.
Although I would not recommend this phone for youngsters, but its ok if you want a budget power filled smartphone.",4
54,4,Overall a fine product to use but as per functionality the price could be less (upto 20000) because this phone has nothing special compared to other cheaper phones.,4

58,8,"Product Good, but battery and camera quality is not good, 50% spend in just 5hrs. Screen display. Camera is not also good there is noise into the screen display.",4
59,9,All the Features and Performance are Good but Battery Backup is too poor. It is the main reason for giving 2 star in rating.,4
60,10,"*Battery life is decent, if you're a heavy user you'll get a backup of 12-15hrs after 100% charge.But as I'm not a heavy user I'm getting a backup of more than 24 hrs.

*Camera is also good, night mode is working good if you have a good light, if not you'll not get satisfaction.

*The main issue of this phone is brightness. If you're keeping your brightness level at the lowest then you won't be able to see things properly in the night also.And outdoor you have to keep the brightness high.Which will affect your battery backup.

*TIll now I have faced only one issue, which is brightness. But rest all are working fine.",4

169,119," Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matter

Display - Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as well

Performance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usage

Software- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better idea

Camera - Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent things

Battery - Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fast

Speakers - 6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate

5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristic

Call quality - Rating 10 : it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbled

So to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",4

172,122,Bought this phone for my Dad who wanted to chuck away his redmi note 7.

Great refresh rate

Battery life is good enough for one day work.

Cons:
1. worst camera ever seen. After click a picture, photos are all blurry, no clarity at all.
2. Phone is heating up everyday, randomly, not on a specific task.

My 4 years old oppo phone is giving 5times better clarity photos than this phone.

527,477,"Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.

Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.

When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.

When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.

When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.

There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).

Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.

Severely disappointed.",2
528,478,Over all super in made range üôÇ,5
529,479,Camera quality could have been better. This phone is not recommended for selfi lover's. Battery back up is good. important this phone replicate the Oppo phones. Those who are using oppo can go for other option. I am using f 15 and this one plus similar tho this phone. This phone is good for business and shopkeeper for batter back up and easy to use. overall phone is good. However the price is high at given features,3

546,496,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of Usage

Design: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.

Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.

Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.

Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.

Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.

Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.

Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",3

608,558,"Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:

Pros:
- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed
- Smooth performance and display
- Comparatively compact and light weight
- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)
- Design and color is neat

Cons:
- Speaker isn't great
- Camera is okayish
- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of now

Detailed:
- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.
- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.
- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.
- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.
- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.
- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.
- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).

Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.",5

636,586," I am editing the review what I am facing in day to day task , using the phone since 3 months :
Pros:
1. Performance is superb, didn't feel any lag or bug yet.
( ***Edition: YouTube unexpectedly closing 2-3 times repeatedly in 1 day , that may be bug which I faced recently)
2. OS & Software: Got 2 security updates & 1 Android update ( Android 11 to 12 next day after purchasing the phone)
3. Battery Charging : 40-45 min approx.
4. Battery Drain: 1 day for moderate user ( WhatsApp, Insta, YouTube, Online Classes etc.)
5. Gaming Performance: don't play any games so look some other's review.
6. Camera: Superb in day light, descent in low light.
7. Speaker: Single speaker is loud enough for your entertainment.
8. Refresh Rate : for day to day task, 90 Hz r.r is smooth enough to perform.
9. You can definitely enjoy 4K YouTube Videos (As HDR 10 Certified).
10. Special Features: Pocket Mode (No accidental impression on screen when phone is in your pocket), Expernal Storage ( Most of brands neglect this), 3.5 mm jack.

Cons:
1. Accidental screenshot is captured due to Volume button. It should be placed on slightly upper portion. You may the face the problem whenever you lock the screen.
(***Edition: You can turn off that features for screenshot in setting)
2. Camera should be improved in low light.
3. It must be upgraded upto Android 14.
4. You can't record any call otherwise it will inform the person that you are recording the voice.

Pro Tips: 1. Use ""Ultra Steady Mode"" to take video for your content/personal memory.
2. Select 'Standard Refresh Rate' for better battery output.

I will edit my review later if I face an issue regarding daily usage.",5

674,624,"Bought this phone at 22K inr. So consider this price for my review.

Camera is hit and miss. Sometime it takes amazing shot, sometimes it just fumbles.
EIS with 1080p60 is amazing. You will capture more videos than expected.

UI: Coming from MIUI. Its very easy for me to say Oxygen OS is amazing. No debate in that

Battery: Amazing, will change how you use your phone. 15 minute is enough for 4 hours of use. It gives so peace of mind, once you tried it you wont be able to live without it.

FP sensor is okay not as snappy as side or rear one but still work fine. You wont notice it.

Feel: Super Slippery buy a rugged case immediately. Amazing to look at like. But feels delicate.

Price: for 22K its a steal. For original price add little more to get Nord 2T, Poco F4, Nothing phone(1) all these phone are affordable flagship.

This phone is just a mid-range phone and should cost 22K for 25 you are better off with spending little more and get those above mentioned phones.",4

 To give you a gist of the review, overall, the phone is 9.5/10.
I'll talk about the specifics in this detailed review which shall give you the complete detailed aspect of the phone.
1. Display
The display is quite vibrant. Brightness is great even in sunlight. Watching movies on netflix would be fun for you. Refresh rate of 90Hz works as a charm. Overall you won't find any issues with it.
2. Processor & Ram
I have played quite decent games on it. Have run parallel apps at a single time. Couldn't find any lag in with this processor.
3. Battery
Your phone charges from 20-100% in just 32 Mins. This 65 W charges is practically a blessing. I have screen time of around 6 hours. The battery lasts 24 hours very easily.
4. Camera
I don't use much of the camera but it is quite Okayish. Won't say excellent but will do the work.
The front camera is quite good.
5. Design & Body
There is a little chin on the bottom of the phone which does not affect much to me but could have been improved. The back silver metallic finish bothers a lot as it shines like a mirror. Also, you will have small dots on the backpanel surface overtime. A cover can be used to minimise this effect. The only reason I reduced 0.5 in my rating is the back panel of the cellphone.
6. Operating System
Loved the operating System, pretty smooth, aesthetically pleasant, charm for your eyes.

Overall this phone is a gem. You can always go for it.",5
816,766,Good budget phone,5
817,767,"Not the best in the segment but good enough considering one plus phone.
Pros: Awesome display, Smooth performance, Really fast charging( 15 to 100 in 25 min), Decent battery backup, Blue colour looks premium and beautiful.

825,775,"I got this mobile for ‚Çπ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.
Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ‚Çπ3000 discount.
Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.
Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.
Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.
Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.
O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.
Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.
Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.
Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.
Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.
Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.
Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.
GB ram is enough for daily operation.
My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ‚Çπ20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.",5

1.The biggest con is its processor. Not happy with Mediatek processor and it's true that snapdragon is better than Mediatek.Processor is slow and you will feel it after using the mbl.
2. Camera is just average

Conclusion: One plus is loosing its glory and I don't recommend this one to buy in this range.",3
829,779,"Biggest mistake was to order at Amazon. I myself went at Amazon depot to receive it because delivery boy was not ready to come at 6 pm. Return is most complicated in Amazon. They fixed appointment with technician yesterday and there is no call till now. Flipkart is best to handle quality issues...Amazon broke my trust this time...it's okay for shopping upto 500/-.
Camera quality is average. Battery is 4500 only but good thing is charging is very fast. Back cover provided by oneplus is white coloured which masks the appearance of mobile.
Moreover, i will use it not more than 6 months due to Camera quality.....which is a little disappointing if you have used Oppo..",4

‚Ä¢camera - not quite great that is you wont expect this from oneplus but in this range I'll give it a solid 3/5.

1049,999,"This is the best smartphone that I have ever owned. If you're someone like me, who wants to jump from the 10k range to a mid-range costing smartphone, I would suggest you go for it. My father and I bought the same phone model on the same day almost three months ago, both of us are not gamers or heavy users, but we prefer the smoothness of everyday workflow over everything else. So if you hate it when your phone takes an extended period of time to open up simple applications, you will love to upgrade to this. I had my apprehensions before buying because of the sceptical comments related to OnePlus dropping its quality, but frankly: I did not see a difference since I have never used a phone beyond the 20-25k price range. Spending more than this amount on a smartphone is just plain splurging in my opinion, especially for middle-class people like us.

It does not have any apparent issues, if you take good care of it, I think it should probably last long.

All in all, if you're looking for a no non-sense smartphone and think of a phone pragmatically and don't wish to delve into minute details, I would suggest going for this without any second thoughts.",5
1050,0,This is my first 1+ mobile but frankly this is not the worthy which I think. Battery also running very fast and camera quality is also not much better. Overall the performance is below average and definitely you will regret after buy this. You can get much better Mobile even at the cheaper price than this one. At the end personally I have not recommend anyone to buy this Mobile.,4
1051,1,"after 4 months of usage, the mobile is very good in terms of stability and managing tasks. but the battery life is not great, using 60HZ refresh rate and all features optimized for the best battery life, The mobile still lasts for only 16-18hrs based on the usage. I am not much of a gamer, and I don't play games much on my mobile. and coming to the camera, comparing it with the rivals this mobile's camera could be a bit better.",4
1052,2,"I was searching a smartphone in 25-30k segment checked lot of phones but could not find a good phone with on screen FPS and dedicated sim/MC slot suddenly I checked on google that 1+ is also launching the phones with these features and then I watched an unboxing video and decided to buy this phone the brightness of the display and battery should be more good so it will be definitely more awesome but as per performance and brand of 1+ phone is good in 23000 (including cards discount) the antutu is about to 5lac when the antutu of iphone 12 (Rs 42k cost) is 6.25 lac so this deal is not bad, but if you are planing to buy so just check the phone at the showroom or on ytube.",4
1053,3,"Bought in big billion day sale but towards the end. My experience is when Amazon takes time in delivering a product, it will be worth it because they push bad product line in starting and immediate delivery. Gifted my mother (58years), and for an elderly person, this phone is perfect.
I was initially confused whether to buy this then went for it after reading reviews that its good for elderly person.
I setup the phone before giving to my mother. And I am using oneplus6t constantly since may 2019. So oneplus nord ce 2 lite felt like a power in hand. Super fluid, battery, camera, features.
Although I would not recommend this phone for youngsters, but its ok if you want a budget power filled smartphone.",4

1059,9,All the Features and Performance are Good but Battery Backup is too poor. It is the main reason for giving 2 star in rating.,4
1060,10,"*Battery life is decent, if you're a heavy user you'll get a backup of 12-15hrs after 100% charge.But as I'm not a heavy user I'm getting a backup of more than 24 hrs.

*Camera is also good, night mode is working good if you have a good light, if not you'll not get satisfaction.

*The main issue of this phone is brightness. If you're keeping your brightness level at the lowest then you won't be able to see things properly in the night also.And outdoor you have to keep the brightness high.Which will affect your battery backup.

*TIll now I have faced only one issue, which is brightness. But rest all are working fine.",4

1169,119," Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matter

Display - Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as well

Performance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usage

Software- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better idea

Camera - Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent things

Battery - Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fast

Speakers - 6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate

5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristic

Call quality - Rating 10 : it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbled

So to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",4

Its fingerprint reader sometimes doesn' work and alternate ways are to be tried. Battery is the only plus point. Camera is just like any other 15K camera (Though at 25K you expect a better camera!). Too many boring compulsory onscreen Apps. Unnecessary two onscreen clocks neither you could delete. Overall a medium camera. 2 1/2 stars.",3

1350,0,"-Phone runs amazing with the dimensity 810 and I only have praise for the performance
-90Hz refresh rate is eye opening coming from a 60hz phone
-Build is pretty solid and the back has a nice texture that doesnt build up fingerprints much
-Redmi has packed the phone with some neat features such as the IR blaster and the surprisingly amazing DAC which redmi didnt even flex about in the marketing. (my headphones sound miles better out of this phone than my laptop smh)
-Included phone cover is alright and its nice of redmi to throw one in (hole around headphone jack couldve been bigger though as it interferes with any aux cables with chonky housings.)

-Only complaints id have are that the design is kinda mid; doesnt look very amazing, but nothing to complain about either hmhm
-Cannot comment on camera quality as I am a pleb who doesnt know how to nitpick at camera quality :P
-Included screen protector is reaally bad( its only been under a month and there are already scratches around the lower screen where id be typing). So highly recommend peeling it off and taking your chances with the Gorilla Glass or just getting something aftermarket

Overall strongly recommend if you're into a solidly built phone that focuses on getting stuff done rather than sitting around and looking pretty",4

5) you can store more data without lagging the phone, it processes so much data without being hang

Sound is good and watching media content is pleasing with its thin display edges.

Front camera is good as compare to back. No any heating or lag issue in day to day uses. Call quality is good, loud and clear but lacks premium phone like quality. 5g capable with mediatek 810 . Security update is slower than low budget mi phones as now I received may month patch and it's already July month. Overall good phone but need improvement through update for sure.

3. Connectivity and network speed is worst in same network and same conditions in comparison to others mobiles.
Camera hardware is top notch, Redmi should work on its software/ image processing like realme. Realme did better in the camera department for last one year.

1868,518,"3 Days Review:
Unique findings:
1. RAM Booster is available with a 6GB variant, it gives an additional 2 GB for RAM Booster. So you can have a total of 8GB RAM. But technically it's not similar to the 8GB Variant. 2GB RAM Booster will help you very mildly boost your phone Speed. But yes, you can tell your friends you have an 8GB+128GB variant. :)
2. Auto Call Recording will tell the receiver that you are recording this call. to avoid this. You can install Truecaller which will give a separate call recording option that won't tell the receiver about the call recording.
3. Charge your Phone when not in use to get a very fast charging than normal. switch off your, mobile data, wifi, hotspot, etc. put on the charge. it will be charged from 0-100% within an hour. Also always plugged in for charging when it reaches 30%-40% battery and stops at 99%. it gives the battery a longer life.
4. 90HZ refresh rate will give you smooth operation but it also drains the battery. First, use it with 60HZ and see if you can manage with it, if not you can go for 90HZ.
5. Switch to Dark mode, White mode will drain the battery faster compare to Dark mode.
6. You can uninstall most of the preinstalled useless apps.
7. Camera is good but the camera software is the worst. You can install camera apps like Camera MX or Open Camera for good-quality pictures.
8. Put your brightness in Auto, It will adjust as per the surrounding lights also it's a battery saver.
9. Finger Print Scanner can only unlock your device. it won't lock your device.
10. Avoid locking your phone with the power button. the Power Button won't last long. Always let your phone be locked by itself by the set timer or you can manually lock your phone using the lock option in side of the phone.

Next Update after a month.",5

1905,555,"Its a new 5G phone, which was recieved in a good original packing. It is supporting 5G mobile network, which has not yet started in India. So I cant comment on that aspect of the phones capability.

It has good sound in the earpiece, but its speaker sound is not that great. Mic is good.

It catches wifi signals but somehow it tends to miss out on some 5GHZ networks arbitrarily. It just refuses to show all available wifi networks available.

Camera is good, but dont expect good macro pics. Video quality is above average. Colours are a bit on the saturated side.

Battery life with average use is 1.5 days. I am no gamer, so cant comment about battery life under intense gaming conditions.

Finger print reader is on side button. It is not always sensitive. I love the looks of the instrument.

I have yet to buy a screen protector. One comes pasted. But being plastic, it catches dust and tiny filth. I need to buy a glass one due to filth. The silicone back cover came with this phone, its nice.

I can use IR blaster on phone to run my Atomberg ceiling fans!

The phone feels warm sometimes. Phone is worth buying.
______________________________________
UPDATE AFTER 5 MONTHS OF USE.

Taking videos in the sun is impossible. The phone heats and shuts down.

Battery life is now just 1 day

It's not behaving like an 8 Gb RAM phone. It tends to lag.

Overall I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PHONE NOW. There are definitely better phones you can buy. If you can not evn make 2 min videos outdoors in peace.

DONT BUY.",3

2012,662,"Some reviews have heavily criticized this phone, however I've been using it for the past 5 days and it's been excellent.
The display is amazing with great contrast and brightness along with a smooth 90hz display which looks amazing when scrolling or using the phone in general.
The phone has a good processor which is more than enough to handle day to day tasks and good enough to handle games.
The camera is great, with image stabilization, AI assistance, etc, but it's not the best of cameras which I've seen. The final image though, looks pretty good due to enhanced picture processing.
It charges to 100% in under an hour or a bit more with the 33 Watt fast charger (I usually don't even need to charge it at night). The battery easily lasts a day with normal usage and can go upto 70-75 hours (3 days) with the battery saver on.
The phone also has several quirks and features which I find helpful.
The MiUI has a minimal and clean interface and is very easy to use and yet has a premium look to it. Small details are designed well, (such as window animations, titles, etc) which show the good quality of the UI.
In my opinion, the Redmi 11T 5G is a phenomenal phone under ‚Çπ20k.",5

Say Redmi note 10 pro is perfect mobile in display- Amoled but point is it's not 5G which is emerging era. How can we expect everything to be perfectly high in single phone ? You can't eat your cake and have it too. We hardly get any 5G phone in this price range if we are going with brand name. So I would suggest to buy this mobile if your budget is approx 18k and would not change mobile in one or two year ( 5G would be emerging fast all over in upcoming years ).

- Camera lags and there is latency in clicking photos

3) I'm not really a camera person but I do take pics once a while. You should know that there is just one usable camera on both sides of the phone. Both of them are great, but the rest lenses are useless.

If your budget is around 27k and not purchasing for gaming then you should difinitely go for it. There are hardly any cons in this product.

#Fingerprint sensor is what makes it different.
#Processing speed is fluent.
#Camera is ok ok (enough).
#Touchpad feels premium.
#SSD makes it a bit more buttery.
#Display quality is more than good in this budget.

The only problem i faced is regarding MS office as OFFICE 365 is pre installed without the activation key as a result we cant access it or we have to purchase it. But fortunately i installed MS office 2021 from external source in minutes so not a big deal.

So i would suggest everyone to go for it blindly and save some pennies without any disappointment cz i have been searching for laptop since 1 month and this fulfilled my all my requirements. Thank you",5

2394,44,"I was sceptical to buy Celeron processor but I bought this because it has M.2 ssd which means laptop SSD speed is high and it's turning on in 5 secs. It has 2.8ghz processor which is also enough if you're a everyday laptop user or even you can do low to mid level programming like Java, python they can run smoothly so go for it if you're looking for a laptop which is under 30k.
Also, i played 4k videos on YouTube and it was running smoothly.
If you a Bca or b tech student and you don't have high budget you can go for it will serve you enough.
Cons :-
Maximum RAM you can upgrade is 8 gb.",5

Celeron N4020 processor is not for gaming bcz in this price range please don't expect laptops for gaming.
You have given 256GB SSD M.2 NVME in just 26990 RS it's enough.
This laptop is only for programming and office work.
Highly recommended those who are looking for best laptop under 30000.
Build quality and look of this laptop is 4.99 out of 5.0 .

There are a few negatives. First, the wire going from the laptop to the screen is very visible at the hinge. This is a potential point of failure and I think it will affect the life of the laptop.

Another annoying aspect is the continuous upselling attempts by Lenovo. The laptop includes Lenovo Vantage software, which could be necessary for some aspects like firmware updates. However, Lenovo keeps pushing users to buy additional software coverage, including by throwing popups on the screen while you work.

Some annoying issues, but I think it's overall a good laptop.",5

 Laptop is good interms of speed because of SSD and 8Gb ram. All applications runs smooth without Lag
Its lightweight very light and comfortable to hold and the design is good

But for me the worst part is display. Its not even HD screen for 28k cost and the worst is its TN panel, because of TN panel i get worst viewing angle. Even if i sit right in front and tilt the screen i see white glare in on screen. The TN panel plus the non HD screen makes a good combination for giving you a worst display. If u work on such display for long you will get headaches.

I think Lenovo giving so cheap display in 28k product is not done.",2

2743,1,"After having frustrating experience with HP printer with its expensive cost of printing (70Rs/ print) we have chosen Canon G3000 printer after carefully reviewing the feedback on choices we have i.e. Brother, Epson and Canon; however disappointed with the performance. Whatever the product is i must accept it, this is only to share my views and not in any negative sense.

Starting with Pros:
- Printer comes with plenty of Ink and that will probably provide ROI with in 2 years considering cost of printing with HP.
- Tech support is too fast, they sent an engineer within 2 hours placing request.

What is not working:
- This is not a simple plug-n-play printer, the behavior of the printer requires good knowledge of how this works. For e.g. you have to leave the printer on for 5 minutes before you start printing. My exp previous printer is almost flawless and smooth.
- Print quality is pale, dull. What you see on screen is not what you get; this conclusion is after comparing printouts taken from earlier printer. However a good point is that the text is sharp.
- Software is difficult to trace, operate and use. Not sure why the software is provided in first place when you can directly fire printout without installing this software.
- Very difficult to understand error codes. The power on light is blinking indicating that there is no paper, however the problem is some thing else.

The above issues i have mentioned are some thing you cant understand/ check when you purchase online.",3
2744,2,"1. Time to get print,
Black and white - 5-6 seconds
Colour- 25-30 seconds
2. You have to take atleast 1 colour copy daily and also do ''Cleaning'' once in 2 days (using Maintenance tab in printer properties). Otherwise, you may have to do Deep cleaning or system cleaning which may consume half of your ink..
3. It will shows errors at the time of paper jam or no ink etc. Some errors would not be solved even after printer off and on. For every error there are certain techniques for solution using Power, Stop and Color buttons. You can search in YouTube for such solutions. No need to call technical team.
4. The printer is noisy..
6. No. of pages per refill depends on how we use the printer.. I think I get approx,
Black and white- 2000-3000
Colour- 2000-3000
Pls note, for Black & White we need only one ink bottle. For colour, we need 3 ink bottles

I refused to pay till The printer is in proper order. The technitian left saying that his boss would call. His boss called and his attitude was very careless and unproffessional. I had to shout back at him. He said I have to change the heads if I want a good print and he also said 'are you printing xerox copies ? For your home yoy dont need good quality.""

2751,9,"Got it for less than 10k in 2019. Primarily for the kids usage and occasional copying of documents and scanning for my usage. The idea was the ink tank is cheaper than cartridge overall. Except for a couple of occassions when left unused for too long(used full head clean to get it to work properly), this works satisfactorily and serves the purpose. Inkjet speed is slower, so it takes a moment to print even when copying, but the delay isn't noticeable since usage at home doesn't involve long queues. I use wifi primarily and it's a bit of a chore when you change your wifi - else it's simple enough to use. Scanner is great and configurable for different speeds and dpi.

I tested this to print on photo paper which was as good as photos professionally printed. Since this is jet, if there is problem with any color it generally gives out Grey's on regular paper. I printed about 1.5 reams of A4, with around quarter of Inks still available. Rough math about 3 rupee per page including colors.

The software for printing is not the simplest, but for a regular user it won't be rocket science either. Overall since it's an inkjet primarily for home use, it's not a bad deal or bad product.

Can be better but given a choice i will happily buy it again since it's the cheapest and best value for money in the branded inkjet printers.",4

However, when i recived the printer it was not packed in default Amazon packing, there was just a black seal around the box with Amazon logo. This was quite awkward and doubt full for me. Now let's talk about the printer- ink filling is very easy there is no way you end up filling the wrong color in wrong tank ( unless if you are color blind ) same goes for print head installation. Before installation of drivers and softwares on pc make sure you are done with initialization of the printer, following the manual. Other wise you will experience errors especially on wifi installation..
Unfortunately for me in my first print during printing the alignment through the installation setup my sheet ( A4 ) got stucked and i had hard time fixing it, ( i had to remove print heads to removed the torned stucked piece of paper beneath them) but it was solved later. after re-trying printing went well. I have no idea why it happened at first. The last concerning thing i found is the indicator light, i had accidentally touched one and they ""move"" along with others. So i can say built quality is fair, a delicate thing.

Finall the instruction was to connect the printer to a computer and then initiate the search. With this the printer succeeded instantly after asking for password.

My point is that I wasted almost 3 hours trying to setup WIFI without connecting to a PC. Is it not better to set up the printer by connecting it to a computer right at the beginning?

Will update review after using for 3-4 months.",5
2767,25,"I bought the product at a steal value, which is good.

Although I was aware that there is no LCD screen to guide me thorough the menus, my geekiness will support me, I was sure.

Installation with my computer via WiFi router was pretty easy. Did a few tries to locate the printer on my network and tried the button shortcuts and finally got it connected.

Prints were good. Ink seems to be drained a lot as 3 prints on, I could see about 15 percent drop in the ink levels. Need to ascertain it in the long duration.

Now comes the tricky part. I wanted to connect it to my phone and another phone not on my WiFi router network. I installed the Canon ""Print"" app and it was not detecting my printer.

I tried detecting WiFi direct devices but was not able to see the printer. After a few tries with the button shortcuts, I was able to locate it in the regular WiFi devices. I connected to the WiFi printer and was able to at least connect the phone to the printer directly. Prints and scans were again possible.

Then came the real headache. The printer was not getting detected by the computer now. By some unknown reasons, this printer is not able to connect to both services, WiFi direct (act as hotspot) and regular WiFi (access a hotspot) simultaneously.

My previous WiFi MFD, a 5000 rupee HP was easier to install, easier to understand and connect and had none of the aforementioned WiFi issues!

I called up the Canon customer care (18002083366) on Saturday and raised a service request. service guy will visit my in 24 hours, I was told. Come Tuesday, I still didn't get the service call atleast.

I gave them a call on Tuesday morning and reiterated the issue. They gave me a local service number. After a few hours, I got a call and I had to tell them the whole story again. Second installation is not free, I was told. I said that the first installation was done by myself. They agreed to come by evening.

Evening they gave excuses that they were caught up with other customers and don't even have the courtesy to lift my phone. I'm still waiting. Will update after they actual arrive. I just hope the service rep has better skills than myself.

I'm pretty sure it's not an issue which can be sorted out onsite. There might be shop servicing needed. I should have gone with Amazon return as I'm still within that period. But I'm being a gentleman, for now.

Update : Gentleman's patience broke. I got a replacement. Problem persists another way.
I realised my 12k Canon printer can only act as either a wifi-direct printer or can access an external WiFi router, but cannot do both, like my 5k HP printer.
The technicians reply made it clear. Sir, canon doesn't have any models in the sub-15k range which can be accessed by laptops vide wifi router and at the same time by accessed by phones vide wifi Direct! Thumbs down.

The printer however served its purpose of printing well in standard and best modes. Draft mode had lines showing up on an otherwise splendid photo.

Another irritating problem with this device is the scanning application. Competitors need to learn from HP. Their scanning apps were so user friendly. This one in yet to find easy ways to scan proud or documents readily with my required settings by default. Not at all user friendly. Instead it pops up like some irritating ads we get online!

Overall, this is an ok device for the rate. The only saving grace are the ciss, which for now works great and the decent print quality for standard and best modes. So far so good.",3

2772,30,"I am writing this review on this printer after using it for over a year. In this year, I printed about 2000+ pages both color and black&white. So my review is based on observations on them.

=== Print Quality ===
This is definitely the brightest point with this printer. I used Epson ink tank printer earlier and were not satisfied with the results of it. But this Canon printer makes the cut. I am amazed to see the results of the printing both color and B&W. I printed many photos on photo papers and the results were better than the inkjet printers.

=== Ink Longevity ===
This is another biggest selling point of this printer. The printer came with 4 ink bottles - Black, Cyan, Magenta, Yellow. After printing over 2000 pages so far (photos and documents) I still see 50% of the ink left.

=== Ease of Use ===
I can connect this to my wifi router and get started in 5 minutes. All I need is to read the instructions carefully. And voila, all my devices - Computer, Laptop, Mobile and iPad - can print without any hassles. They can detect the printer and starts printing just in minute.

=== Paper Feeding ===
In my more than one year experience with this printer, I never faced a single paper jam. If at all something happens, check paper feeder if any small objects stuck accidentally.

=== Scanner ===
Not used much but overall quality was ok. If you want crystal clear scans, this is not for you.

=== Copier ===
Its just a click of button. Keep your document inside the scanner and click on blabk or color button. Your document copy is ready.

=== Issues ===
So far I came across only one issue. The printer orange light starts blinking and the messages shows that the ink cleaner bed was overflown and needs a service. But I followed the instructions on Youtube videos, cleaned the ink cleaning bed and cartridges for 4 to 5 times and then the printer came back to normal. But this took over 4 hours to understand and solve the issue.

=== Advice ===
1. Do not perform system cleaning too many times. This will cause overflowing of tank on ink cleaner bed and malfunction your primter.
2. Do not use cheap paper, use paper such as JK Sparkle etc.
3. Do not print photo prints on normal paper, use photo paper or thick paper.
4. Make sure to print few papers at least once a week with all colors. This will reduce color logging inside the tubes.

Overall, I am very satisfied with this printer and the quality of prints it gives you.

Update 11/11/19
I faced one more issue after long time. The printer unable to feed the paper and I couldn't find any object inside the feed. After two days of struggling I came up with an idea of reverse feeding the paper from inside the printer, i.e. open the top box to see printer inside and switch off and onthe printer. While stopping, it reverses spinning wheel and load paper manually to it just in time. Voila, it started.",5

Overall considerable product.",3
2785,43,"Chose canon over others due to its mega reputation and Classy size & shape.Its all-in-one ability supersedes all contemporary brands.

Here are my few observations of the product :

1.) Its an ink tank printer that comes with separate ink tanks to be filled with ink red , yellow , blue & black .Its always considered to be more economical for per page printing and should be chosen if you have bulk work on a routine basis.

In these ink tank printers, it is also required to take prints on a minimum weekly basis or prolonged non-usage may lead to drying of heads .

2.) The construction of the printer is very elegant and solid and the ink tanks are absorbed in the regular chassis of the printer unlike HP brand, however it is my personal preference.

Solid doesn't mean you can afford to drop it , it means the plastic used for construction feels very premium and rigid.

3.) Regarding functionality - It can scan and print documents very fast .Page size supported is from 4.0""x 6.0"" photo paper to A4 ,Letter ,Legal , A5 , B5 .

I purchased glossy kodak photo papers 280 GSM & paperone A4 100 GSM papers and the print quality was excellent.

For pictures , it takes few minutes but its worth the wait .If you choose the right paper the photos are bound to be very good ,However at few places i found the shade of green slightly dark in print than in actual photo that was scanned.

Resolution is good for both photos and documents.

Printing makes slight noise but is tolerable , its not like neighbour or even other room person will be disturbed.

4.) Got it with additional warranty for onsite repair for next 2 years.

5.) I bought it first then realized i don't have that much work to use it on daily basis so i would ask my readers to buy only if you have routine works or make use of shops.",5

It was easy to install. YouTube videos helped. Tech support was not required.

The only complaint I have is that the yellow ink level automatically went down fast, though it was initially equal to the cyan and magenta ink levels.

Wifi connectivity helps a lot in printing. One PDF got printed via desktop correctly, but got blank pages via the Canon Print Inkjet app on mobile.

Overall, it is a great buy.",5
2789,47,Printing is very slow ü¶•ü¶• with a loud sound,4

2795,53,"Print Speed is slow, connecting issue with mac",4
2796,54,"Got it on sale, so paid much lesser than the original price.

Pros:
1. Ink tank printers are money savers in the long run and work for longer as well.
2. Premium body finish and look
3. WiFi connectivity is the best thing you can go for, its future proof. If its linked on your router, you can print documents from any corner of the room via any device without having to go the printer. Even desktops dont need a cable to connect cause it prints via the local network so you can place the printer anywhere and use it flawlessly.
4. You get additional black ink bottles which is a plus point.
5. Lower maintenance needed than other printers.
6. Borderless printing is great.
7. Atleast 2 prints within a week is important to ensure the printer works at its full potential. Also, if printing is not possible, atleast switch on the printer once in 3 days to allow it to self clean itself. These practices will ensure your printer wont get any problems.
8. Free installation provided by Canon which you should definitely avail.
9. Refills are way cheaper than cartridges.

Cons:
1. Installation isn't very straightforward so even if you are a genius at figuring things out, I suggest you call the Canon service centre for a free installation setup. They are well versed with it so and its free so dont mess it up by doing it yourself.
2. Print quality is, okaayyyy. Nothing WOW like. Haven't print photos yet so cant talk about that. But regular printing is lighter, as if its trying to save ink. Or maybe my setting is off, cant really say.
3. Scans are really bright, high definition but sometimes light colours come off as white in an image due to bright illumination. Can be rectified via settings in the Scan utility interface.
4. First print is slow. You have to wait for the printer to do its stuff before you print something. After that, the prints are quicker.
5. Pretty noisy when the printer head undergoes adjustment before and after printing. Also during its self clean operation.
6. Vertical paper inlet doesn't allow you to stick it against a wall so you'll need more space at the back.
7. Print alignment occasionally gets angled but its kinda rare.

Verdict :
Although there are a few cons, the pros beat them anyday. If you're looking for a basic home printer or small office/shop printer where you can save money in the long run and still have a decent working product, then go for it. Plus Canons service is pretty fast and efficient so you can always avail their facilities if any problems arise.",4

2803,61,"Too early to tell but my initial experience has been good so far. Will post more after few months.
I am casual home user and Its my first printer. Since i preferref thermal head so i narrowed down to canon and hp , went with canon due to paper size support and of course extra black ink :) . I am a geek so installing this printer was super easy ( step by step documentation would have been helpful for many, will post a youtube video). I also connected it using wired, direct wireless and with my router (using this last option now and i can print from any device connected with my router. To connct press wiressless button for 5 seconds then B + wiress button, now its trady to pair with router, so press pair/wps button on router and done!! Use canon print service with default apps/function on mobile/pc ). Everything super easy. I preferred using other print apps so didnt use selphy app. Even used google cloud print ( this would any be out of business by 31st december) , one drive and ij cloud print and . Works perfectly. If you are not a geek and a simple home user I would recommend to always buy this. In general go for AIO (All in one) wireless inktank printer which supports upto 270 gsm paper. I am not a photo enthusiast so cant tell much about photo quality, seemed good enough to me. Tried 270 GSM paper, no issues ( its major plus points over HP 410). If you are ready to spend 12-13K rs buy it without much thinking. A LCD display would have been definately helpful for troubleshooting but not a show stopper ( you can always check error codes in web server as well).

Avg customer care, Ink and print head seems cheaper than other companies.

Printer in this class are costly (this one is cheapest in the class when compared to other companies like epson, brother and same as HP 410). Given that these printers are simply a 4K - 5K wired inkjet AIO printers with inbuilt CISS kit and a low class print server, should not have been more than 8000-10000 rs.",4

3. Quality: Just okay. Less than Laser printers. You will need proper application and set printer preferences for a good print. Else you get faded colour print. 3.5/5
4. Photo print: Colours not lively. Appear faded. HP inkjet even offers better print quality. Physical dot Marks appear in prints. Contacted Canon, they say it's the Marks left by roller which feeds paper. Not satisfied. 2/5
5. All in one use: Good. The scan utilities needs to show preview which I didn't find like in Hp. 4/5
6. Connectivity: In today's world purchase only wifi printers although it costs 2k INR more. You can use any device to print. Don't place device far from wifi router or access point. Configure static IP in router for all your devices else you will face problems.

2816,74,"After using it for a whole year, on regular basis, I am reviewing it.
Ink- I don't know what to tell, but the ink which I had put last year, its still there, with 50% of it remains in the ink tank. The best ink retention printer I have ever bought. Cartridge's are a total waste as you have to refill them or buy a new one every 3 month. But this, don't worry about ink problems at all for at least 1 year.
Connection- Well the usb cable provided with it, is very short in length, which proves to be a little discomfort. Well I had an extender so no worries, but many of you don't have it, so invest in a bigger wire, or a extender.
Print quality- Well...‚Ä¶. I only take print in draft setting, so you know. I have taken some In ultra clarity settings, and they came out to be good, perfect, crisp, but wasting a lot of ink. Never used any other paper than the normal 75GSM A4 printer paper.
Printer problems- Well sometimes in rainy season, the paper gets damp with the high humidity in my place (Mumbai). Well as it gets damp, the paper gets struck in the printer, and removing it is a hell of a job.
Connection- Very easy and with just couple of apps in your phone, you can wirelessly take a print. Easy wireless settings.
Interface- Lol, my earlier HP 3235 had a better interface than this, but was ink sucking. This has only some basic buttons, but does the basic job of a printer.
On computer settings are vast and interesting to see. You can do a lot things with the canon apps available in the CD given.

Summing it up, if you are a regular printer user, for home, then go for it. 3 500 reams of paper have already been finished by me, and still ink remains in the ink tank.

GO for IT

Update after 2 years

Well the printer's scanning motor went bad and i had to replace it for 2000, which I guess is necessary regarding that its been 2 years of the usage. The printer still prints and works flawlessly.",5
2817,75,OVER ALL GOOD,5
2818,76,I am using it for 3 months now. The quality is good. But was not able to use the wifi feature.. bit complicated to enable that. Anyway it's a good printer.,5
2819,77,"This is a 1 day usage review. I will update the review after 3months of usage.

Cartridge and ink install was simple.
Pc or Mobile setup is extremely confusing. The instructions need to be more clear.
Im using the printer over router wifi
My clue: Don't try to setup from mobile. You will go crazy. I have a windows pc.
Perform the setup of windows pc option first. Run the application given in the cd. Select the option of wireless setup after running the option. Complete the process and the printer will be setup with your router.
Then setup via the Android app. It will succeed.

I liked the print quality. Currently I'm using plain A4 paper.

B&W is awesome and printing is fast.",4

When the item was delivered it felt disappointing that neither option for multiple copying/ photostat nor even a 7-cell basic display panel has been provided in this printer, which are very basic features that should be available in a printer.

Missing : Duplex printing",5
2827,85,"I bought this as a regular all in one printer but ended up using it as a photo printer most of the time after seeing the quality of prints üòÖ.

I have seen mixed reviews for this printer so I would like to elaborate my experience for everyone after using this for about a month .
Pros
1) Print quality is very good.
2) Photo prints are much better than expected with Kodak glossy photo papers ( Better than expected from a 4 cartridge inkjet printer).
3) Print, scan and copy speeds are very good .
4) Works well as a network printer. Easier to print via WiFi than I expected.
5) Canon print app once setup works well.

Cons
1) Initial installation and integration with Wireless network and Canon print app requires a bit of work.
2) No duplex printing option provided.
3) Since this uses ink tank technology a bit bulkier compared to traditional inkjet printers.
4) Buttons provided on the printer doesn't have their functions mentioned next to them, just having icons can be a bit confusing especially the colour and b&w copy buttons .",5
2828,86,"So far I like the printer. It seems to be user serviceable. 1. There is two user installable/replaceable printer head. One for Color and one for Black. 2. The ink tanks are easy to fill. No need to worry about spilling the ink when flipping upside down. Just don't squeeze until the nose is in the hole of the tank.
I bought this printer because I wanted to have one where I could replace the ink myself. I am so tired of paying through the nose for ink cartridges! And this printer has very easy to fill ink tanks, does both black and white and color prints, and has easy to figure out settings. The prints are crisp and clean, no streaks or other problems. I have not printed any photos, only documents, but they are all great.

I think the reason it works so well is possibly because it doesn't have all those other bells and whistles. But whatever the reason is, I am extremely happy with it. I hope it lasts me for many years! And the way it runs, I would guess it will.

I did have a problem with initialization. The tanks are a bit more complicated than cartridges. More problematic, though, is after filling the tanks, you must trigger the initializtion procedure. The manual just says it takes six minutes but never says how to tell if it completes successfully. After connecting to computer it took an hour for me to realize something was wrong and another hour to find their error codes. The canon website is huge with dead ends and loops. I suggest registering and using the MyProducts page to start. This quickly locates manuals, videos, trouble shooting, and an on line tech chat. Once I found this, the problem was quickly resolved with a replacement. I also suggest looking at the support videos that show setup. I give 5 stars because this printer has a well thought out design and works good, canon provided excellent support, and buying ink by the bottle is very satisfying.",5
2829,87,Ok types. Takes time to start printing.,3
2830,88,"Reviewing after 2 years of use.

Printer is quite good when it comes to quality. Cheaper on the long run. A lot of features. Good print quality.

One major concern is that it is quite difficult to use most of its features. There are things like direct wifi connection, access point mode, etc for which you need to do a lot of button combinations.
These button combinations are hard to remember, so youll have to refer the manual constantly.

If you think you aren't tech savvy, you won't need most of these features. But then again, these are some very cool, useful features.

(With this printer, you can even print from another corner of the world through Canon cloud printing service)

I would recommend canon to provide a single button for each of these features, or a small display. Doesn't cost much!

Hit like if you find it helpful.",4
2831,89,"When compared to Epson it is cheaper and reliable . Ink costs just 500 for whole set . U can see the difference in printing quality.

2833,91,Everything is good in this printer but only printing speed is not that much good....,3
2834,92,"Good print quality. Print speed is not great, but acceptable. Build quality is not that good. The LEDs near the buttons wobbles when touched and plastic quality is not that good. Setup was easy to do. You don't really need to wait for canon's installation. I tried with 280 gsm photo paper and images are good even in borderless mode. Printing a full image on an A4 photo paper will take a lot of time. But photo printing speed on 6x4 paper is OK. Black and white copying and printing is quick enough for home or small office use. Apps are OK to use. But you can't do high quality scans from mobile app. You need the PC software to adjust scan quality. That's the only limitation I noticed on the software side. Ink usage is very less. I couldn't see any noticeable drop in ink level even after printing 100 pages. It's a good deal for the money as I bought it during the great Indian festival. Not sure if it's worth the price it's selling for without the discounts. I can't comment on the durability now. But I'll update the review if something goes wrong.

Amazon delivered an already opened box. the original tape was removed and it was repacked. But the inside of the product looks all new and I was able to register it on canon's website and warranty was shown till December 2020. So it appears to be an unused product. It could be a product that is returned by someone after opening the box and not setting it up. It works perfectly and there are no defects. But still I expected better packing. There was absolutely no packing at all and the printer was visible if you lift the side of the lids. The lid wasn't even taped properly. The rating I have given is for the product model, not for amazon or the seller.",4

2843,101,"Few points of my experience can make your mind. Been using it since an year and its great in print quality and advanced features. But....

Pros -
1. Great color prints...
2. Low cost printing...
3. You can give print out directly from your mobile at just a touch/click via wifi. Just install Canon print app in your smartphone

Cons -
1. During lockdown , i didn't used it as it was kept in my office which costed me 3400 Rupees for head change. Reason - you'll have to print atleast a page daily without any gap. I contacted service support and they informed me now. Earlier call centre employees told me about printing atleast once in 7 days. So if u have less usage , laser printers will be better.
2. Keeps sounding frequently without any reason many a times like as if you have given a print
3. Slower printing speed compared to laser printers...
4. Customer support is ok but i feel angry they didn't told me earlier when i asked them clearly. Service executive who came to install it was a kind of very rude person. Didn't expected it from Canon like multinational brand.

Believe me Ink tank printers (this one) is far better than cheap inkjet printers but do keep it in mind about Cons above. Choose wisely between Inktank and laserjet printers according to your usage. If u need high quality, low printing cost and advanced wireless printer at very affordable price , order it right now. Its at great discount on amazon and usually is always at great prices during every great indian festival sale.
Easy to install in windows 7 or higher. For XP you will need service pack 3.Mobile app is world class...!",3

2849,107,"Writing this review after just 13 months of purchasing this printer. Over these 13 months I probably printed around 100 color pages for school projects. Prints were OK. But what the product details don't tell you are:
üö© If you don't use this printer almost daily or at least on weekly basis, this will generate periodic problem with its printer heads
üö© So, be prepared to face the dreaded B204 error (or some variation of it)
üö© B204 basically indicates a communication failure from printer head. But guess what - heads are almost 3 - 4K (yes, almost 40% of the printer cost).
üö© Over this period of 13 months (& print of ~100 pages), I came across this B204 issue 3 times. First time, I lodged a complaint over Canon app - where technician closed the ticket without any reason or communication.
üö© After some serious attempt a technician was finally put to work - who called and advised to put the printer on service mode and do a deep cleaning of print heads. Thankfully that trick worked and printer was back in action.
üö© The second time when this error happened I followed the same trick of rebooting post service mode and it worked again.
üö© Unfortunately now it is no longer working and since it's beyond 12 months, Canon technician asks for Rs. 649/- for visit. And I know they will eventually change the head and charge another 3-4K.

So, what's the point in buying such a printer? Which can't even last a year. Really shame on Canon to even sell such a shabby product in the first place.

Conclusion:
üö© If you have regular usage, this may be ok. But I will still recommend NOT to buy ink tank printers. Rather buy printers with cartridges (not ink tank).
üö© If you have infrequent usage, buy laser jets (well, yes - you will mostly be stuck with Monochrome for lower price band - but it's still worth it)

I am going to dump this sob printer for good! Such a waste!!!

Update March 2022:
Had to pay 649/- for a service inspection and it was found that the PCB (the motherboard) went bad! ü§ï A replacement ordered and had my purse lightened by ~4K. Be cautious!!!",1

Printing in color, black and white and photo is really easy and hassle free. We have printed tons of pages and photos just from our mobile. Ink usage is low and print a lot between refills. Finaly raising complaints via WhatsApp and technician visit within 24 hours made me very happy with the purchase. Their is a down side. A. You need to download all the drivers from the web, which means your system may not auto detect the printer. But the good news is there are no hassles after installation. B. Installation of software is a bit cumbersome, but the printer is fast and prints well when installed. So not exactly a negative, just a heads-up. Good choice for a family printer.",5

2856,114,"Ordered this product, Amazon delivered earlier than slated, with all precautions, given the pandemic situation. Quarantined the box and was skeptical how I would do the installation without the support of a company representative.
Cut open the box and was amazed at the neat and clean packing. Installation was a breeze. Decided to use patience as the key and reserved two hours on Sunday evening to install in 'no hurry mode'. Followed the instructions as given the 2 booklets (1 for hardware installation and 2 for software/driver installation). Just adhered strictly to the instructions substantiated clearly with schematics. Took 30-45 minutes to patiently install and was ready. Lift and ensure you lift the printer lid to the assembly is firmly locked before you undertake the hardware installations. Finding the power outlet was a visual challenge and gave myself a good laugh after I saw the instructions where the power outlet was located.
Gently peel off the stickers where applicable and also placing the cartridges gently is the key. Gently emptying the ink into the well marked ink tanks. Take extra care in being gentle to open/close the caps to ink tanks and the lids. And firmly close the lid completing the hardware installation.
Now for the software installation - surprised to find a CD-ROM, but went straight to the Canon website and downloaded the drivers. On Win10 and also on the iPhone, setup was a breeze. .On Win7, I have a small challenge (may be related to the Win7 upgrade). Getting to print a test page was quite easy. I used the JK Copier 70GSM paper and it worked pretty well.
The entire printer and its assembly looks great from design and manufacturing - the Japanese way is very evident.
The only option that I still need to figure out is a way to see if there is a 'Draft' mode further use the inks in an eco-friendly mode.

Overall, very happy and proud to have purchased this....and the price of ink refills will be more economical.",5

Wifi printout via app seems to be an issue returning with no communication with the printer. Check network etc. black ink only filled 3/4.

If you are a newbie to printers some of this stuff won't be easy for you

The Canon Pixma is a Full Featured no hassle WiFi(LAN) and WiFi Direct P2P enabled monster.

It prints seamlessly on regular 75GSM A4 paper with wonderful clarity in both black and colors.
For Photos you can start from 180GSM Glossy Paper to 275GSM easily and depending on your photo editing skills you can truly bring any picture to life.

The printer has a 2 phase setup with comprehensive documentation in the box

English Instructions are readily available for first time setup followed by how to sync with PC(Windows/MacOS). And Android iOS phones.

Many folks have posted vague feedback stating they donot like print quality.

Let me say categorically it is a very nice mid level printer and at 9K (Lightening Deal) quiet a steal.

Please feel free to go ahead if you are a techie and enjoy using photo shop,GIMP or other image editors.

This printer is not for newbies
Also they have given 2 Xtraa blank ink refills with the box,

I am very happy with it's build quality as well and have faced no issue s in printing over WiFi(LAN). Or via my Android Pie phone

In short go for it if you love to print lots of photos or are interested in small office or WFH business.

Good Luck will post some content printed with G3K soon.

Happy Independence Day 2019.",4
2872,130,"Brought this printer as was well aware of the problems associated with inkjet printers in the long run.Complete value for money...good prints..have used it for a month now and around 700 pages of prints including colour prints and I am happy with the quality.The wifi app helps prevent unnecessary hassels however the app could be more user friendly in terms of editing and multiple prints on a page which I found lacking.Overall a good buy...if you can buy in some sale with discounts and all ..then best thing.I BOUGHT FOR 13999.
4 stars for the app otherwise printer 5 stars.",4
2873,131,"I bought the Printer with lot of Expectation and this Printer is performing pretty well, it's true value for money and colour print quality is good provided you use correct paper. As my son is currently having sessions online it is very much usefull for last moment projects and Assignments which needs to be submitted within timeline. My avg print per month is 200 Black n white pages and 50+ Colour pages . This printer uses less ink and it's easy to refill inspite of using it for last 2 months ink level in the printer have more or less remained the same. You need to just keep using it with minimum prints both colour and black n white. I miss Duplex Prtinting option which is not available for this printer this would hae saved lot of time and papers. Last thing is print cost is very low as Cannon Provides 2 bottles of black ink bottle which can be used to print lot of black n white pages. Hope this review helps you out.",5
2874,132,Best ink tank printer,5
2875,133,"First of all, kudos to Amazon for on-time delivery of product. Placed the order on Saturday and received it the very next day despite it being a regular delivery order. I was a bit hesitant at first while placing the order given the ordeal a few of the buyers had faced here. The seller was Appario Retail Pvt. Ltd. But, thankfully, everything was in place when I received the package; all the seals were in place. All the bottles were packed. I got the GST invoice too. So, overall a nice purchase experience.
Coming to the product, I was in 2 minds whether to go for G3000 or G3012. But since GST credit wasn't available, I had to go for this one. I wonder why they can't give a GST invoice on the other one. Setting up the printer was a breeze. Just make sure that you go through the installation manuals first. A little more of text and not just images in the manuals would have been much more helpful. There's a short animated video regarding the installation procedure by Canon on Youtube as well. That was really helpful. After going through the manual and the video, the setup took barely 15 minutes. I see a few reviews telling that the printer consumed a little ink even before taking a single printout. Well, that's so because at the time of setup, the printer sucks a bit of ink to fill the pipes going to the print head. The per print ink consumption is going to be really low post the installation.
I tried my hand at interfacing the printer through direct wi-fi to my Android smartphone first. It got connected without any fuss. Haven't tried connecting it through router yet. After having both the devices paired, I got a nice colored document printed first. It took around 8-10 seconds and print quality was great. Next I printed a document in grey-scale. The output was great and it took under 5 seconds to have the document printed. Next, I scanned a document to my smartphone and it disappoint me this time either. Will post an update once I try it with glossy photo paper.
So all in all, it was a great buying experience and I am completely happy with the purchase.",5
2876,134,"Canon G3000
Pros: It well built. It prints well. It has lots of ink to store and it is cheap to operate.
Cons:
Setting up the WiFi was a headache. Finally managed it. The biggest drawback is either it is connected to wifi through router or each device independently. You cannot have both options at the same time. The second concern is there is no duplex printing so back to back printing has to be manual. The printer does take some long time to print and is little noisy too. The Canon Selphy app is fine but not very user-friendly in selecting the document and making the print setting changes.
I have not called for the technician for the installation but it did take 2 days to set right my WiFi router connectivity. As I said I used it with direct connection until then, but once wifi router is connected this option is lost.

Overall a recommend buy at this price just for the sake of cheap operating costs for this printer and print quality is definitely good if not the best at this price point. Beware that this printer needs to be used frequently otherwise it will create ink flow, alignment issues if unused for longer periods of time.",4
2877,135,"GO FOR IT, its been almost a year of using this device, and the performance is phenomenal, i am an advocate by profession and use this almost daily, there might be other cheaper options available, maybe with more features, but this Japanese boy, has the built quality for a decade at-least, printing speed is okay, but quality is excellent, if you are buying for personal office / home use do go for it, very strongly recommended. (bought for 12.5k in 2021)",5
2878,136,"I exclusively bought this printer for wireless printing for my kids school work. Sadly this model of canon printer DOESNT SUPPORT AIRPRINTING THROUGH APPLE DEVICES . Tried with iPad and iPhones with alike results . Trying to return the product but I have to go thru canon customer support and SO RETURN ISN‚ÄôT EASY and frustrating . I‚Äôd say avoid this printer and go for hp which has better connectivity than this over all platforms.
Also, the print quality is dull than desired from the standards of school work expectations.
The attached screenshot is from my iPad where I can‚Äôt find any air printer attached when both this printer and my iPad are on the same Wi-Fi connection.",1

2880,138,"It takes a lot of time to initialize. And stops printing regularly. Then when the ink is changed, it works. But print another 100 sheets and the ink finishes. Not recommended",3
2881,139,Very good lroduct,5
2882,140,"Good product and value for money overall. I‚Äôve read some reviews that the colour ink doesn‚Äôt last the number of pages advertised- and this may be true of you are taking high DPI colour prints (like photos). For daily colour prints I‚Äôd advise switching to a lower resolution. I‚Äôve taken about 40-50 colour prints so far and the colour inks have gone down by an average of a quarter tank and the black tank has hardly gone down.

Installation is nowhere as simple as a laser printer but if you follow the instructions pamphlet it shouldn‚Äôt take more than 10 minutes. The biggest problem I faced was setting up the wifi network for the printer - had to install an app on my phone and had to fiddle A LOT before I got the wifi functionality to work. Once installed it works like a charm.

I‚Äôve been a laser-only user for the past decade so the monochrome print quality is a bit disappointing (compared to a laser printer) and this printer is noisier than comparable HP models.",4
2883,141,"Such an incredible cheating by Canon. They are saying it can print high quality photos, if there any black coloured area in photos, the printout shows a magenta shade in that black area. Also the whole printed photo will fade the colours to an yellowish colour in one week. connectivity is little bit difficult while configuring wifi. The technician from Canon also tried a lot and finally he said this printer work like this. If you are looking for a black and white printer go for this. Others please chose some other brands.

2885,143,"Stuck b/w choosing HP/Epson and Canon, I went with the Canon G3000 - this is just day 1 review. The main reason for leaving out HP was - made in PRC. Epson ( made in Philippines) lost out due to overall build quality which is found was many notches below Canon's ( prints may be slightly better than canon - marginally only). Canon G3000 - MADE IN Vietnam - super easy self install which took about 20 min all in all. Already taken about 100 pages of print and the quality is just above average - not awesome, but that works as I mainly use this for some basic office printing and majorly for children's study materials. There may be some electronic parts in this which may have come from PRC but the main thing for me was a non PRC build and this one had it. I would suggest anyone looking at 150+ prints a month to go for this. Overall rating at 4 as its a very new product for me and may think about bumping it higher based on further usage........",4

2890,148," The product reached on time, however, I was a bit skeptical so made the delivery guy open the box under my camera's recording.
Received 6 bottles of ink which are amazing, 2 additional black.
I had to download the setup via the internet since my laptop didn't have a DVD player.
The installation process is very hectic and irritating takes a lot of time..
But it's a one-time process.

The quality of the print is decent as I have attached the video.
Hopefully, there will be no issues in the coming month. I will update the real review after using it for a couple of months.
Got it at 14100 rs price. which is expensive but overall cost-benefit analysis as claimed by the cannon is 6000 prints in 600 rs for black and white and 7000 prints for 1200 color ink makes it economical for the ones who have to print a lot for their educational and work purposes.
mobile app usage is very convenient. overall 8/10
since there was a lot of dust inside the printer when I opened it I was furious as if I was sent a used product but I took it sportingly and didn't raise a replacement. Let's hope for the best.",5

2892,150,Very effective printer..... Print quality fantastic.... Must buy for the home use,5
2893,151,"G3000 is a nice product.

Its an ink-tank printer, that is, Inkjet with a tank to store the printing inks.

Please note it doesn't support duplex printing. Duplex printing is automatic printing of both sides of the paper. G3000 is more of a manual duplex. You will have to pull out the paper after one side printing and then put in back into the printer to have it printed on the other side of the printer.

Print quality is good. Please take 75 GSM papers or above ...If you use lesser GSM papers, it will feel like the printing is not good. Actually a lot depends on the paper type, as far as printing qualities are concerned.
GSM stands for GRAMS PER SQUARE METER. It depicts the thickness and therefore the quality of the paper. Try buying 75 or above GSM papers from local market. The prices in Amazon are kind of at the higher sides.

It support WI-FI connectivity , both over a Wifi router and wifi direct. If you have a router then try using it over the router , otherwise you will have to switch networks a lot between your router network and printer's network.

The installation of the device is a little techie. If you are not comfortable let the support team carry out the installation. The installation is free.

Scanner is pretty good too.

The printer can be calibrated easily from the laptop or mobile application.

Lastly, try to use the printer atleast twice a week. otherwise caking might occur.
Overall its a good printer to use.",5

I have failed multiple times to connect android phones to the printer but somedays are better than others. The usb may or may not work, finally, windows 10 inbuilt software works. I don't know where the issue is but the lack of a TFT screen on the printer is a huge disadvantage.",4
2899,157,It's been two months since I purchased this printer and in 2 months it had to be serviced twice by disassembling everything and putting it back previously used Epson printer which lasted for 10 years straight without any defects should had stuck with Epson only completely filled with regrets,1
2900,158,"I opted to buy this printer over Epson or Brother or any other company becuase of 2 reason. 1. Price (same features model with wireless costed 3k more for Epson) and 2. this Supports Borderless printing from 4x6 size upto A4 size. meaning you don't need to cut of edges after printing as her wont be any borders, The Utility software along with the package is quite good. i used it to scan and print wirelessly and it worked like a charm. wireless connection is very stable. i bought this for 8500 for Great Indian Sale. it comes with 2 extra black and white ink bottles so its 18k black and prints out of the box! so if you compare it with printing cost outside it straightaway negates the printer costs. overall a great buy! printed some color photos in glossy papers and it was fairly good. exceeded my expectations.
NB: about seller and Amzon service. i have had a problem delivery of printer since they where flooded with deliveries during great indian sale, which never used to happen with amazon. but they sorted out everything quickly and made sure i receive it. So Kudos to Amazon Service.. Cheers!",5
2901,159,"Good Print Colour quality even in A4 sheet.
Average print time for 2 sheet of black & white copies/print is 30 secs and for 1 colour print/scope is 30 to 40 secs.

2906,164,"Well, this is my first review about any product on any website so far.I would rate the printer 4/5.I was using a brother DCP-7065 DN laser printer earlier, switched over to inkjet due to the following reasons;
1)Wanted to switch over to colourful/vivid printouts than printing only on monochrome, basically got bored over b/w :)
2)Better yield .Yet to confirm for canon g3000
3)Wished to switch over to one with wi-fi printing enabled, for that, even my brother 7065-DN also could do the same, but after being connecting the same to the ethernet port of the router.
4)Wanted my desk to be less cluttered with wires.The canon does this job brilliantly, all I have is just a power cable connected always to the mains (it has got an auto wake function)

So Finally the printer was ordered online after having a look at the real printer across various stores at Cochin.The printer arrived after 3 days and the packing was good.Unboxed the product to check for any damages, as i was expecting some due to the reason the printer was bit heavy (8.2 kg).But since the canon packing was good and sufficient, the printer was in good shape.
Took me around 2 hours to install the printer with ink/setup/test print.Would like to mention that the user manual/setup is not very easy as given on the canon website.Have to do some trial & error for fixing up the same.Initial setup for wi-fi took too long , just to figure out what is to be done.

But once setup properly, I found that it a good printer which is VFM.
Pros:
1)Auto wake function, even if your printer is off, it will switch on if you give a print command (provided, it is plugged on to the socket)
2)Fast printouts
3)Good quality scanner
4)Occupy less space on your desk
5)Less clutter on your desk, as it's not having too many wires
6)Less cost per print compared to inkjet printers (yet to be confirmed, will update later after a months usage)

Cons:
1)Too complex to setup
2)No ethernet port provided
3)No auto duplex
4)No ADF
5)No display panel

Also, the price is few hundred bucks less than what you get in stores.I also got 2 additional black ink bottles free.",4
2907,165,"After use of 3-4 months, I recommend this printer to all small businesses.",5
2908,166,"Its been around 2 week I am using this printer. And I must say the document comes with it help you to install it easily with your own.
Wireless connectivity is very good. Easy to connect with multiple device like I have connected with Phone and Laptop both.
Color Print: Quality was good. In starting for few prints (first 10 print) would use lots of color and it look like it will finish early. But wait if we understand initially it use color to fill the tube that's why took lots of color in first few page. After that it work like charm
If you are using glossy paper then make sure after print put the paper aside atleast for 24 hour, to settle down the colors. Otherwise if you use your figures or anything it spread the color unevenly and damage your print.

Limitation:
1. Auto duplex printing is not available
2. ADF feature not available.

Overall I would say for home usage you can completely buy it. It worth it.",4
2909,167,Good Quality and easy to install,5
2910,168,"The printer was easy to set up and use the Wifi direct paired to my phone. The app needs to be installed which isnt the best in UI but does the job.
One odd thing i found (check pics) is that color inks werent upto the top arrow mark like the black ink. I'm not sure why bcoz i emptied the entire bottle into the tank. The color prints have not come out bright and they look a bit dull. Was expecting better print quality on white 75gsm paper. Black prints are quite good.

Update:
The photo print quality on 200gsm kodak 6x4 is quite good. Higher quality paper would also give good results. The speed of printing is impressive and no washout or anything observed. After printing 4 pics, the ink level is the same.",4

I went through a lot of reviews and i'm glad I selected this one. The print quality is fantastic. Not only is the normal black and white print good but the colour printing is absolutely fantastic. I've already printed so many of photos (I used Kodak photo paper to print photos) and they have come out fantastic. Brilliant colour. The scan quality could be a bit better but I'm not complaining as it does its job well. Also, I checked on the ink refill cost and its much more economical as we simply need to pour the ink in from a bottle as opposed to changing the entire cartridge. Another plus point is that you can connect this printer via wifi so you can print from your laptop/tablet/phone directly to the printer sitting clear across the room and not fuss with attaching usb cable. All in all a great printer. If you're looking for a multifunction colour printer please go ahead and buy this without a doubt. Installation is also very easy. You can either install software from the disk provided or go to the URL in the instruction manual and download from there (if your laptop doesn't have a CD drive then this is beneficial).

I called up and even though the person who repaired by computer said it would be a year guarantee nothing will happen the service Center didn‚Äôt stand by it - neither did the person who did the service. In any case, the very fact that the printer is getting spoilt so fast shows how awful it is- and with no good after sales service or people who stand by the service, it‚Äôs ridiculous.. DONT BUY IT!",1

Print Quality:- Good as expected from canon, printing speed is nice on plain A4 size paper at standard quality setting.
Economy:- Got three bottel of Black ink 100 ml each along with 3 colour bottles 70 ml each, though company claim 7000 black and 8000 color prints per set of ink but it not to be seems to possible. As per my experience it will print almost 2000 pages per sets at standard setting but if u r planning to print photos on photo paper at higher quality then colour tank got suck very fast althougt it still very very economical than cartage printer.
Installation:- Very simple and straight forward just go through some youtube videos, dont relay on user manual iys just good for nothing.
Conclusion:- Printer is overall good, look nice. As a inkjet inktank printer you have to take some precautions like Protect it from Dust is must and keep printing in every 2 to 3 days.
And please go for wifi version it is lot more convenient like you can place it anywhere u want and print from almost anything that has wifi.

2933,191,"i finally decided to go back to an inkjet after a decade - picked this on a whim as a replacement for an old b/w laser (which in turn was a replacement for an inkjet which terribly expensive cartridges)
Setting this up wasn‚Äôt particularly easy

Setup - 3/5: The physical setup of installing the cartridges and network connectivity took a while although I believe Canon does offer a doorstep installation service (which I did not use)
The software installation on a Mac was quite easy for the printer setup although setting up the scanner for wireless scans did take a while

Do note that this does not support airprint natively (although there is an easy workaround if you have any linux machine on your network)

Cost of prints - 5/5: the tank is a beast, i have taken quite a few full color high quality prints but do not see any visibile drop in the levels

Quality of print: 4.5/5 - Text prints and general graphics are great regardless of choice of paper
However I was initially disappointed when i took photo prints on a generic brand glossy paper - the colors had a yellow cast and looked dull and different from what I see on a monitor‚Äô

However once my order of a kodak 280gsm glossy paper came in, i realized the issue was with the paper.
With the higher grade photo paper, the color rendition is practically the same as the monitor

As a printer it does whatever it should, however when it comes to iPhone support it fails, you need to rely on it's canon selphy app, It doesn't have support for Apple AirPrint and more the times app is not available to print. for example if you want to print your emails from iPhone, You just can't.

printer setup is easy , only time i faced issue is configuring WIFI

Also If in case your printer runs out of paper, it doesn't sense added paper, all I had to restart printer ( it pains when you want to print both side manually)",3
2940,198,"Great product with good scans and little short of good for printing.
Please do buy a cover for the printer as it helps protect the printing heads from dust.
Just follow the instructions in the manual and it is a breeze to set it up.

I personally never called the tech support so I wouldn't be able to comment on how good they are.

Setting up the Wi-Fi printing ability with a router might be a task because every time your phone or laptop disconnects from the wifi network the printer also becomes unavailable.

Preferably set it up independently.",4
2941,199,This Product is best as expected. the print quality is very good and seem to be very cheap. Wifi is the best option one can have in a printer. scanning is also good.,5
2942,200,"Good product for day to day printing, worth it",5
2943,201,"Print quality is awesome. Easy to install also. Working through app is also fine. Doubt about their claim of 600(b/w) and 7000 color print. Although scanner is not good at all, It scans documents fine but photo scanning is worst",4
2944,202,"Really very much good experience.. print quality super as expected...

4stars coz of print speed.. but High quality makes speed slow..
Black and white print is fast but it scan each time if we give same page multiple orders...
Earlier i used hp ink tank but that design is good for rats.

Thanx to canon that it has 70% less space for them.. just need to put something in output tray to get rid of rats...

Will prefer more to a printer which will have less space for rats...",4
2945,203,"nearly its bean 1year, its working fine.
color print is getting lighter other than that every this is good",4
2946,204,"We been using this for 2 weeks almost. Connectivity is a very big problem. The wifi is never smooth. Every time it needs to be kind of reset. Very disappointed as this looks to be not so well tested product. I think I made mistake to choose this.
Update: revising rating from 3 star to 5 star. The real issue in connectivity was faulty router which caused printer to not work with Wifi. When I changed my old router with new device printer started working as expected. So as of now I don't see any issue and happy with the product so far. The ink seems consumed more but will revise the review in case ink is the issue. Will update further in the interest of potential buyers.",5
2947,205,Very nice printer small photo shop printer,5
2948,206,"Repaired atleast 10 times in a year, spent more than the printer price. Printer estimate given by Canon authorised dealer for routine repair Rs.7,600 just after a year of use",1
2949,207,"Very disappointed in the beginning when I received a used printer by this dealer.

But thanks to Amazon for quick replacement after raising a complaint
After limited use, my score out of 5 would be,
Built Quality: 4.5
Installation and setup: 5
App interface: 4.5
Print quality: 4.5
Scan quality:4.5
Printer noise level: 4
Wireless and USB connectivity: 5
Over all rating: 4.5

This is the best printer for Home use, Kids Project and small businesses.
I purchased this printer mainly for, 1. kids homework
2. Scan and print office documents, photographs, sketches and paintings in multiple sizes up to A4

I will more feedback after using few months",4
2950,208,"Photo quality is not extraordinary but it's fine for mobile photos to be stored in hard copies at home. Good thing is it supports all types of gsm 65 to 270. All in one feature makes the printer unique. Overall, Can't say excellent but worthy in this price.",4
2951,209,"This is best printer .. and also support manual duplex print system .. wifi and speed also good .

Thank you Amazon and seller",5

09/07/2021 service center says invoice is not eligible how can I get help",3
2953,211,Good product and good quality,5
2954,212,"It's a nice sturdy product. The packaging by canon is awesome. The printer was well insulated from all sides and although they had warned that ink from bottles may spill, the way it was double packed, there is almost no chance of spillage until one opens the bottle. This is an early review of the product. I will leave further feedback after a few weeks. The following are the pros of the printer.
1. Quick prints, both b/w and color.
2. Can connect vai a router ( for multiple devices) or directly using WiFi for a single device like smart phone or pc.
3. If u read the instructions chart given and follow step by step the installation is very easy, but you must have atleast some prior experience in handling a printer.
4. Optimum ink is provided in the bottles, such that not a single drop is wasted.
5. Once installed and initiated ( takes about six minutes) the printer prints fast enough each time, and we don't have to wait for the ink to fill in the print head each time( this was my misconception before buying the device)
I still have to try borderless photo printing to see the color print quality.
6. It came with two extra black ink bottles apart from the required set of ink. That itself is savings of about a 1000/- RS.
Cons:
1. It is heavy
2. I wanted a legal size scanner bed but this has only A4 size. Considering the footprint of the printer a larger scanner could easily have been integrated.
All in all a great product and I do not have any complaints from it yet.",5
2955,213,good,4
2956,214,Valu for money,4
2957,215,"Product: It‚Äôs good, worth for the penny spent.
Seller: They guaranteed next day delivery but it‚Äôs delayed by 3 days
Warranty: Unable to register warranty, it says the product is manufactured in non India & Singapore. The product I got was manufactured in Vietnam so it‚Äôs not eligible for warranty in India",4
2958,216,"I am not sure if this can be used for Commercial purpose but does on-par domestic home printing.
Have tried on regular A4 and glossy A4 photo paper, got best printing of the photos.
Gave 4 star just for one complaint:Paper Jam
I use 80 GSM A4 sheet , still some times paper jams.
apart from it, this is definitely the best printer on the market",4

2961,219,"When the box arrived, I doubted the contents inside as it was just a big box taped only along it's length, with a gap on two sides. But upon opening, everything was found neatly sealed and in order. This is a totally value for money printer, as it comes with two extra black ink bottles. Scheduling of installation was easy. I called up Canon toll free number, obtained the contact of the service center, and called them up to schedule the installation. The service engineer arrived the next day and did the needful. The complete process took about half an hour. He asked if I wanted to install through the router, but I opted for simple installation, wherein I could print directly from my smartphone and by wiring the printer to my laptop. Print quality is excellent for both color and black and white. Got this one for a great price of 11690. I had gone to stores and checked out prices elsewhere, but at all other places the price difference was 2k or more. Got the best price on Amazon and went for it. This printer is excellent for home use and small businesses. I have not checked how many copies it gives with single cartridges, but it should easily give thousands of copies easily. Will give it's money's worth with the cartridges provided. The number of printed pages claimed for a single cartridge is for 7% print area. It is advised to take a few prints every month to avoid keeping the printer too idle.",5
2962,220,I have been using in my office from last 2 years and purchased one more recently for my home use and the quality of the printer is just great and highly recommend this model. Make sure you do not leave the printer not used for more than a week as it clogs the ink path. Otherwise no issues with the printer or scanner or copier.,5
2963,221,Product is good. Only drawback which I could not see in the product description is that the printer does not automatically does front and back printing. You have to turn the paper and reinsert flip side to have double side paper printing,4

2965,223,"No batch scanner
No dual page printing",2
2966,224,Good scan print,4
2967,225,"Good printer and very ink efficient. The down side is that it‚Äôs not an air printer and doesn‚Äôt work with Apple phones. I would have expected this feature as a basic at this price point. My earlier printer was HP and was low cost but it had the feature. Similarly, the PRINT app that supports this printer also has a poor UI. I wish Cannon did something to improve the app.",4
2968,226,"1. There is no two sided printing support (Auto duplex mode) in this printer. Costing 13-15k its expected that this feature is available in the product.
2. Set-up is not smooth as with other products.
3. For iOS devices this printer will not be seen in Air-Printers list.

For me its a disappointing purchase.",2
2969,227,"Printer is good. Easy to set up without tech support. We haven't had to call tech support sice we bought it. Happy with print quality. Was very useful during Covid times. We have printed multiple color copies ans photos but the ink level is still high. Definitely worth to have for home and small business purposes.
One small is that wifi has to be reenabled multiple times. It doesn't connect fast enough and stay connected.",4
2970,228,"I needed this for my cousin who usually prints photographs for his customers, and he used to spend a lot of money on printing from the cafes'. I was a little skeptical about buying Canon, as I am more on the HP side. But this printer is absolutely cost-effective when it comes to printing, and the quality is superb.

I have rated 2 stars on the 'Easy to install' feature because it took me a little while to turn on the Wifi for a direct connection. A little confusion on the paper, and the web too. But it worked.",5
2971,229,This product delivery was good but i am seing the color is not prominent and it disconnects very often . A doc of 45 page took me around 2 hrs as it was disconnecting repeatedly and if paper is exhausted the printer is starting from page 1 it is not giving option to resume the print. Canon service is monopolistic and is not timely one. Within 6 months of purchase 3 times techinician has visited us already so can think of the quality of the product as well.,4
2972,230,"One star less for documentation.
It took lots of time to do wireless setup on this printer, no where in the setup instructions it is mentioned that printer only support 2.4ghz internet.
Make sure you are connected to 2.4ghz network, this printer doesn‚Äôt support 5ghz network.

Otherwise printer is good",4
2973,231,We've received a defective product. Scanner was not working and because of this the whole unit stopped working. We had to raise the issue with Canon. They got it fixed but we were not able to use the printer for first 20 days because of delay due to lockdown.,4
2974,232,"I received the product within the time span provided by amazon.The packaging was good.Installation procedure is provided on the canon website in a step by step manner.I got it up and running in around 30 minutes.The wireless printing and scanning works brilliantly with my laptop.For mobile devices, canon app needs to be installed.I also tried out cloud printing which does work but i do not use it frequently.I have been using it for more than a month now and am quiet satisfied with it.The quality of prints is good and the printing speed is decent.I do not have to worry about replacing the cartridges or in this case to fill in the ink anytime soon.Scan quality is also good.For an ink tank printer the size is very compact which i like.The main drawbacks would be that the printer is a bit noisy and the built quality is not very robust.Nothing that affects the performance of the printer though.The printer came with 6 ink bottles,Two black and one each of blue red and yellow.The picture of the print that I have posted is on a 6 inch by 4 inch photo paper with high quality settings.The price point is also good compared to other ink tank printers.All in all I am satisfied with the product and service by amazon.I would like to give a 4.5 rating but unfortunately that is not an option.",4
2975,233,,5
2976,234,"This printer helped immensely during the lock-down days. Lot of school/office project work could be done. It was very easy to install, installed it on my own. Print quality is good at this price. Got it for 12K. People might have got it for less earlier but during the lock-down and no offers, this was what I could get.

While playing, my kid accidentally threw some tiny plastic toy in the input paper tray so it was causing the paper to be jammed and I couldn't get it out. Installed cannon support app on mobile and registered for a technician to visit. He visited immediately the next day and sorted out the issue. This is during the lock-down/restricted days. So very happy with the support.
Only one issue with the printer is the color ink gets consumed relatively quickly. Black ink is very robust, I have printed many pages but still shows a lot of ink is available.
Overall happy with the purchase.",5
2977,235,Received defective product 1st time. Service engineer announced it as DOA. Amazon worked amazingly fast to replace it very next day. Have been using for month. No issues. Easiest to use with cannon app.,4
2978,236,"Good printer. Prints sharp texts like Laser Printer, hence no need to buy Laser printer if anyone buys this. Nice scanner generates high resolution images. Copy printing quality not 100% accurate but 90% accurate because scanner stick glows very bright white light and maybe it's common with every printers but the company should update their processing program to fix this. Canon mobile app do not have many features so use computer. So 4 Star rating.",4

Just did all by his own and left... Totally a bad experience from Canon. I must have gone to HP or another printer...",4
2983,241,"Prince quality with installation is awesome. Wifi printing with multiple page selection and quality selection is added attraction.
The only thing which i realized is poor is print speed lilltle bit slow and for copy you have to puch buttoms again and again as no of pages to copy is not available there.",4
2984,242,"Firstly, the delivery was given on the next day of the order. It just great to get it delivered so fast.
Secondly, the printer is awesome and simple to use.
The initial setup will take up some time but once done it quick.
The wireless connection is nice, takes time to understand for setting up, but once done you can print directly from any of your devices like Laptops, Android mobiles or iOS mobiles. Its simple.
Setting up of wireless connection instructions are not provided in the manual and you would need help of Google there.",5
2985,243,Took the printer and used it for over a month. Wifi and Wifi-Direct are both working great. No lag or loss of signal. Print quality is great. Setting up and installation is super easy (we can follow the video on canon website for step by step setup). Download the software (part of setup steps) and install - drivers and software will get downloaded with 1-click. Mobile app is also very good and we can connect to the printer through wifi and get the print. I am very happy with the printer and the quality.,5

2996,254,I am using it since last 2 months. Works perfect. Not sure if the ink would last for 6000+ pages as advertised. I see already 1/4th ink used for few 100 pages. Photo print quality on glossy paper is not that great. Also no calls from Canon customer support for installation. Self installation is not easy with the given printed instruction. I did it watching some YouTube videos but it took 2-3 hours for complete setup.,4
2997,255,"Bought in May 2020.
So far the print quality has looked average.
I realised it doesnt have paper storage - its a good feature to have.
Its supports double sided print but manually. So you have to put the paper again to make it peint on the other side. Another good feature to have.
Installation was ok with the help of youtube videos.
Wifi setup was a pain but i got through it.
Nevertheless, i hope it stays good for a few years.",4

3000,258,"Printer arrived on time with good packaging.

I was comparing it with HP 410 and HP 419 but finally decided to go for Canon as this is not made in China :-).

Printer installation is easy. In case you need to configure printer with wireless router, download the software on PC/Laptop and configure the printer via USB cable, that's lot easier than WPS way.

Once configured, printer hardly takes one minute to power up and ready for the printing. Also printing from laptop/mobile over home wifi is quick, didn't face any issue in lase two days since installation. Printed around 25-30 pages and printer seems quite good. Hope it last long.",5
3001,259,"The quality of print is good as well as printing speed is quite remarkable. Canon as a brand has evolved a lot in different fields and as for photography sphere, their name always prevails.

3005,263,"The printer looks terrific and since I have used the earlier model in my office I can say that the ink tank lasts a long time bringing down the cost of printing. Tech support was great, arrived within 24 hours of call and installed the printer. The wi-fi function is very convenient and its working well (though there is a time lag between print command and printing - but I guess that's to be expected). The first page print takes a little time but there-after its fine. Over-all, very satisfied with the printer till now. I just hope that the ink doesn't dry up or the nozzles don't get clogged due to infrequent use.",5
3006,264,"Hi Everyone,

It been over 6 months i'm using this printer at my home.
It is being an experience to get it working and use.

Lets talk about the positive side -

1. Auto Power Off, but comes online moment you fire your print
2. Print quality is excellent (while i was very wary before buying this printer)
3. A silent printer
4. Per page cost ever on full color is in paisa
5. Its a wireless enabled printer (2.4Ghz) supported
6. The cost of inks bottle are very reasonably priced.
7. It can take print from mobile devices such as Android / iOS with Cannon Application installed via Wi-Fi Network
8. Very detailed troubleshooting driver and application

Lets talk about negative -
1. Buy this printer if you are a techi
2. Whoever wrote the printer manual was very techi and hence lots of steps
3. It will throw error 5200 / 6000 and ask you to take it service center ..
4. You will need lot of patience and glass of beer to do troubleshooting ..

Finally, It's worth the pain :)

Enjoy !!

3007,265,I was confused between HP / EPSON / Cannon models and based on various research went with Cannon G3000 finally.I had an HP one earlier and never remember using it more than one week without troubles. So HP was out during the initial stage itself. I did not configured the wireless and was happy with USB printing but it looks like it is dhcp enabled and connected to my home wifi automatically. I realized only when I started getting additional printer option on my OS. Used for scanning/ printing / copying many times in the last one moth and it do the job very easily. Normally for any product I go with company where that product is their primary business. Looks like that policy was helpful in this purchase as well. Thanks for reading.,4
3008,266,"Am writing this after using this for over a year. This printer is meant for regular/ daily use. DO NOT BUY IF YOU USE IT SPARINGLY.
If you use printer sparingly ie once in a couple of days or lesser then this is not the printer for you.
Sparing use causes regular cleaning of the print head and wastage of the ink. Also, this waste ink is collected in a sponge inside the printer. Once the spine gets filled up the printer will stop printing. Though this is a safety feature to prevent spillage of ink, it is detrimental for people using this printer for lesser printing load.
I am trying to replace the sponge and restart the printer but that's a process in itself.

So please think before you buy. For regular use it's a good printer...",2

3016,274,"I am Writing this review after printing Almost 2000 pages-

Setup -
Setup was easy just go to YouTube and see the setup video. And also follow the instructions provided with the printer.

Printing (Major Concern)-
Printing was easy on WiFi and USB both. (I only use WiFi connection to print)
Print quality is good in color and black and white both
‚ö† Initially ""Print head"" uses some color ink (about 15- 18%) to charge the head so initial page yield is less.but after that you get the almost same page yield as said.
Didn't faced any issue till now (No paper jamming , color bleeding, incorrect color output etc etc) Printer is running normally.

You will get 2 extra black ink bottle (Total 3 black ink) so for a regular home user it will be sufficient for at-least 15 months

It doesn't have duplex printing but printing on both side is very easy (Just follow the instructions)
The Only thing I will mention as a Con is the Noise , It makes decent amount of Noise while printing but i think all the inkjet printers do that

Overall its a Very Good budget printer.
Got at very Attractive deal during Great Indian Sale @ 8499 (after all cash back and discount)
Canon Customer support is also good.
In my opinion Its best in its price Range",5

Everything needed, and the installation was quite simple, apart from getting it connected to the WiFi. You will have to insert the CD and follow the process, to get it connected to the WiFi, which could be a little tricky.

Once the installation is complete, it is a very easy to connect to it if the device is on the same network. I haven't tried WiFi direct, so can't review about it.

Speaking about the print quality, it is excellent. Keep in mind the quality of the paper, the quality of the source image and the App you use of printing makes a world of differences. I tried printing pictures on a Kodak Glossy paper using my phone and cannon printer app, the quality was not as much as I expected. Was a little disappointed, but when I used GIMP ( a free photo editing app ) on windows and selected the right size of the paper. The print quality was awesome.

Document printing and Scanning is perfect, you can print through any app, even using mobile the quality is awesome.

The wireless connectivity is acceptable,sometiimes it needs to be restarted to connect. I would have expected a little better overall for the price.",3

3033,291,"After one month usage,my review..
First read instructions carefully and watch YouTube videos and do installation.. Or simply call canon helpline for installation during working hrs.. If u do mistakes in that it may damage your printer very badly.. download canon selphy app in phone. Keep wifi router and printer in close vicinity for better speed. Once everything is set its a wonderful printer. Daily 30mins switch on the printer for head movements.. Print one black and one colour every three days for making your printer in good condition..",4
3034,292,Very good,5
3035,293,"Following the instructions in the manual the Set up worked flawlessly with WiFi and prints and scans in Linux as well without any hassle once set up in CUPS. Initially I had to set up the printer networking configuration using the Canon app in iPad and once the printer is set up on the network, CUPS automatically detects it as a network printer if connected on the same WiFi network. In iPad disappointed that it does not have AirPrint support but printing works with the canon selphy app. The print quality is decent enough though I feel the black is not dark enough. Print speed is decent enough. I have yet to check the scan quality though scanning seems reasonably fast.

Will update this review after long term usage to report on issues faced if any.",5

It's good printer. Have been using it for a month now for occasional printing. Print quality is good. Haven't tried photo printing yet. But normal colour printing is good. Only downside was the initial installation which was quite confusing for a first time guy. But once set up it works smoothly. WiFi printing via mobile app is very very handy. I recommend this printer for home usage.",5
3039,297,Very bad experience in long term review,2
3040,298,"Great product for this price. Very reliable and easy to use. The only problem is that the drivers are not easy to install; there are multiple drivers on their website and you have to follow a specific sequence during installation which is not mentioned clearly. I had to do some research before I finally got it. Nevertheless, it worth a buy.",5
3041,299,"After 2 years of use, the printer stopped working. When taken to a service centre, they said to replace board worth around 3500.",2

3046,304,"This model is exceptional value for money. Great delivery service from Amazon. They have also included 2 extra bottles of black ink in addition to the bottles provided for the first topup. Setup is easy - there are videos online which guide you through the setup. Wi-fi setup is easy to do on the laptop and on the mobile (using the app). Only gripe is that the scanning software doesnt come bundled and it is quite expensive if you go for Canon's readIris software. Overall, a good buy as this printer is feature-packed and pricing is pretty good compared to the competitors.",5
3047,305,Printer is good overall only drawback is that the wifi connection to the printer is not very user friendly. The printer should have a small display to understand what's happening.,4

Due to COVID-19 I did not get proper installation, I installed myself it's easy and also I got some help from the person who was supposed to install over the phone. But after installation it's very easy to use. And the wifi feature is very useful as I have no computer but I am able to give all my prints from my Android phone without connecting any cable very easily. This printer is also very ink efficient so saves money if you have use it regularly.

Go for it.",5

3051,309,"Brought this for home use. Setup went as explained in the canon website. The video description worked without any issues. Scanning and printing through wifi has been working fine (2 weeks old). The good part is there are lots of videos on this model in youtube, so its easy to find info . Cannot comment on the color print quality, have not used that much.",5
3052,310,"A nice decent product, useful and easy to use.
It did take some help to set up WiFi but once done it's super easy to operate the printer.
Print quality is good, haven't yet tried on photo paper but color documents have good prints. One can scan and copy too from the mobile app and directly save the scanned documents on mobile, which I feel is an added advantage. Print speed isn't that slow either, I would certainly recommend this product. Only thing I am not sure is whether the printer will deliver 7000 colour pages with the ink that is given with it .....time will tell. But in all a good purchase....even for parents who need prints for school projects.....",4
3053,311,"Thank you amazon. It's been almost two months, not a single problem the printer is working very fine.",5
3054,312,"Easy to setup, print quality depends on paper quality and print speed is 5sec for B&W and less than 10 sec for colour.",4
3055,313,"No need of buying costly printers and then keep running behind service guys.
You will always be on mercy of Service Guy from Canon",5
3056,314,"1. Product is just okay for the printing.
2. Speed is enough for office/small office requirements. But I noticed that the colour photographs become fade with in 2 months of time. I don't know this can be rectified.
3. This is not justified with the amount we paid.
4. Paper will jam many times.
5. Don't use deep clean option until unless you really want that as it consume heavy ink from all tanks
6. You can use ""Noko printer"" and use manual mode to select Pixma series for choosing printer via wifi set up. This apk can grab from google than Playstore. Canon wifi apk not at all worthy in this case.

Update after 1 and half years of usage..

Printer got dead because it's formatter board become faulty. This because of the worst 24vdc power adaptor supplied along with this machine. While printing on individual method (seperately from printer which is not attached to my PC) electric shock is showing around 110v ac. This caused and leads to the fault to PCB. The power adaptor is just 2 pin not 3 pin(no grounded) which carry AC voltage along with DC. Beause I could check all the metal parts and got AC Current all round as stated above. Please make sure check same with a tester and confirm your printer have no issues like this.

I have to change the formatter board and power adaptor which will cost around Rs.4500/- installation/labour charges is extra.
*****
On jan 31,2022, I replaced both main board along with adaptor. Which cost me Rs.5000/-. I have connected with adaptor with a 3 pin wire which I provided earthing aswell. Now the 110v ac current gone. But have facing another problem. I couldn't print black colour texts without uncheck the boarderless printing option. That means boarderless option unavailable after new board installation. Since I don't have other choice to buy another one I decided to repair and maintained.
I hope this review and comments will help to maintain your printer better for long run.",1

Photo print on glossy paper is also very good. Could easily connect/print from wifi.
But print from wifi would take some time to print but ok for home purpose.",4
3059,317,Fantastic Product from Canon. Horrible instructions to follow. It is easier to follow the 150+ page instruction manual found on the canon site. It works with 2.4Ghz only and not the 5 GHz. WPA has to be enabled on the router and then the printer to be added to the router first through the local router settings. Only then the laptops and others can be configured. Direct USB connection is a breeze.,5
3060,318,"The best printer at this price point. No issues at all till date. I was planning to go for PIXMA G3012 because of the built-in display on the top of the printer but the stock was out, so I bought PIXMA G3000 instead.

authorised Technician visited my house on 19-11-2021. On inspection of the said Printer, he has given his estimate (1) Main PCM Assy ... Rs.2,950/- (2) Power supply unit Rs.1,470/- and service charges is Rs.650/-.
Total Estimate is Rs.5,070/-. It is almost half of the cost of new Printer. This happened exactly after one year. So my request, not to buy Canon Printer, because their spares are very expensive.",2

Prints from mobile using Canon App. I have never faced any wifi connectivity related issue while using it with mobile phone or laptop. The printer is meant for home use and I use for school projects, printing a few photos and other small odd printing/photocopy jobs at home, and the print quality is suitable for the purpose.

Another reason why I bought this printer was border-less printing feature. But.....after 20 days when I started scanning documents I realized how pathetic this printer is....I tried scanning a basic document with white background, and text in between and signature and stamp at bottom, and this printer simply isn't able to pick up the correct color. In document mode, the background color is white as per my requirement but the blue stamp and signature just fails to be picked up. ...I tried every freakin setting, tried photo mode for scanning, it picks up the stamp and signature but the background becomes bluish/greyish. And then when I print it, the printed document is of different shade compared to the original. In other modes, sometimes the details are there but the blue signature and stamp is scanned and printed as black. The same document I tried scanning with my nephew's Epson L355, and it so easily pickups all details while also keeping the background clean and white as it should be for an official document(also the size is small) Not just this I tried printing the scanned file from Epson printer on both Epson and my canon printer(same quality paper), and my canon print it so dull even with high quality ON. This printer is only good looks and nothing else...I dont know what is the problem, maybe a defective piece or over image processing which is spoiling the result but either way canon can't even do basic job properly. There are so many unnecessary stupid settings and softwares but none can do the job properly....and by the way i am geek so its not like i messed up the settings",2

The only option is left with you that you must print at least 2 or 3 color print or else your print head will get clogged and you will end up with system cleaning and eventually ordering 1500INR color every 2 months, that is the canon quality, drain your pocket every month forget about 60 paise print.",1

Epson has lead me to believe that a wifi printer is easily accessible via wifi and once paired/connected to a device I can easily sent print instructions. That isn't the case with Canon I suppose. Duplex printing isn't available. Unfortunately, I had assumed double sided printing to be the norm now. It was a rude shock to realize that isn't the case after I'd set up the printer. I wish there was a better and more comprehensive description of the product specs on Amazon.",2
3142,400,"When I recieved the printer and I opened it, the entire packaging was filled with ink.
When I took out the printer, the ink bottles were already unpacked and empty. The printer ink tank was already filled, which should be empty in a new printer. This filled up ink got spilled during transportation.
The printer head was already attached, which again comes in a separate packing in a new printer. The packing itself was missing from the box and the heads were attached and the inks were already flowing through the pipes.
There was not even a single orange protective tape attached to the printer or its accessories. Ideally there should atleast be 7 to 8 protective tapes protecting the internal parts of the printer. Not only it was not there, but it was not even present in the box.
It was clear that someone else had used and returned the product, which was then retaped and given to me.
This is totally unacceptable and day by day these incidents are increasing. We trust the sellers so much and this is what they give us in return.
Dear amazon, have some quality and product control otherwise its not far for your condition to become like other e-commerce portals.
I have initiated a refund lets see how it goes.

Easy to use
Do not forget to cleanse all the tubes through system cleanser time to time..
It's been almost 14 months I have been using it rigorously..
It works great, though there have been minor problems of page congestions at rare times, but then you have troubleshooters for everything. There're YouTube for help as well, for every other situation.
Refilled the colours once as well...
Trust me there's no better printer+scanner+photocopying gadget at this range; even beyond this range for personal and office use.
One of the best printers I have used!",5
3181,439,The best printer in the range.. Brilliant quality and the ink black or color seems to lats a lifetime.. Great app as well for the PC with very helpful types.. I set it up myself without an engineer and it works like a charm... One of the best buys I have made ever.. Just but this one with closed eyes... It's an MFP as well... Low on cost in terms of ongoing maintenence and refills... This will save loads of money in the longer run..,5

3183,441,The product never worked from day one showing green and orange light blinking ..booked acomplaint and technician said there are parts missing and not working after replacing the attached part ..still now black head is not working so now placed a request to change that part..this should be replaced being a brand new piece and almost all internal parts faulty ..very bad experience,1

3185,443,my previous 6 year old printer had auto duplex printing. that was Rs 4500 when i purchased. This G3000 was 3 times the price and Auto duplex is not there. Manual duplex does not help. A printer for 15K is not supporting it.,1
3186,444,Good product little expensive,3
3187,445,Printer is very slow. Sometimes it irritates you..,3
3188,446,Best in market. Installation require some patience and tech support but all is available on official site. You just need some of the time .All the errors are simply solved if not you can consult YouTube. print quality is really good. Printer is pretty nice.,5

It is wireless so you can print anything with your phone or iPad. It also so have extra neat features which is like a cherry on top.
Recommendation: Buy a cover for it in order to protect it from dust or debris . Trust me it's super important .",5
3195,453,Very good,4
3196,454,Very happy with the quality of the print and efficient ink utilization. Black ink toner is not even half even after printing more than 2000 pages.

Printing quality is not up to the mark, the prints are coming in very very faded manner even though you select the bold font.

Photo printing is also not up to the mark and definitely not suggestible for the people who wish take the photo prints

Its really hard to set this up to print via cloud and even after one week also I was not able to set this up. This is really a complicated device to set up for cloud.

Over all this is not a great choice!!!!!",3

Anyways got issue temporaly resolved through service engineer ('jugaad'), and then printer stopped working in next 3 months, now again having to pay for visit, spare etc. Support is rather rude, like, we cannot guarantee service engineer can come today etc. They dont have a customer focused mindset.

Seeing the ink tanks can be an issue, as you feel it's getting over üòÅ. Don't think that's the case. I had used an HP in the past and was a pain getting a print out of it.

The best feature is that on an A4 Sheet it can do Borderless Printing.
To top it all up Canon gives 3 Black Ink Bottles free and 1 each of CYM.
The Wi-Fi feature is also a rocking one as since the time I have unboxed the cable to connect it to the PC is still sealed and I am using the full feature set without any problems, even printing from the phone is Fab!!",5

3 Phone printing is too slow.

4 . So over all not a good printer as expected.",3
3238,496,"Printer head and ink will last for only few hundred prints, replacement printer head costs 3.5k (1 - color & 1 - b&w)‚Ä¶replacement ink costs 2k (color + b&w)‚Ä¶effectively, you would end up spending 5.5K every year just to keep the printer alive‚Ä¶canon is no exception, printers are a scam across the brands‚Ä¶",1
3239,497,"Affordable Printer for long run.
Scanning and Printing via Wifi a bit slow.
Installation is a bit tricky

Update after 3 Years of Use
----------++++++++------------
This printer is intended for heavy users and not for sparing home uses.
The ink will end up drying if you keep printer for some weeks and you need to perform deep cleaning which will drain a significant amount of the ink.
Also, Canon made this printer for making huge profit on after sale services especially after the warranty period.
Within two year you may need to change the Main Board + Power supply/ or Carriage Assembly and Print Heads.
The above parts they made to sell for exorbitant prices especially for Main PCB and Power supply around 6000 Rupees and 2300 Rupees for Carriage Assy.
Also 1700 to 1800 Rs for color and Black print heads + 400 to 800 Rs for Ink Collection Sponge per year.

This will happen again and again within a span of 1 to 1.5 Years and you will need to repair it again and again by spending lots of money. They made the quality of their PCB circuit like that.
I already spend around Rs 8000 additional only for the repair and the device currently again become faulty and I need 6000 Rs to repair it.
Obviously Canon is making lots of E-waste in India until and unless they reduce the price of the cost of their spare parts.",2
3240,498,"Well, just go for it, I initially had doubts regarding the quality and maintenance of inktank printers and whether laser printer will better, but this one proves to be best for moderate use.
Seemingly there is no problem of drying up of ink as sometimes I haven't used it for a week but it printed perfectly even after.",5
3241,499,"As a consumer printer, the usability and drivers are absolutely trashy. The wireless charging connection is a hassle to set up. For this amount of money, this is a poor job done by the Canon engineers. Much better is expected from them",3
3242,500,Excellent..user friendly,5
3243,501,"EVERYTHING IS FINE. BUT IT'S COLOUR PRINT IS LITTLE FADE.
LITTLE COMPLICATED BUT AFTER SOMETIMES YOU WILL GET IT.

NICE PRODUCT! MUST TRY ONCE.",4
3244,502,"It is really good product. This is my review after using this product for one month.
Pros: 1. It is easy to install with cable. Wireless
2. All resources like CD ,USB cable are available.
3. Additionally, You Tube video is also available for guidance.
Cons: 1. Little Expensive
2. Wireless is little tricky.",5
3245,503,"Firstly, for 2 sided prints, the paper has to be manually reversed, and worse is that the printer keeps showing errors when trying to print the reverse side (error light blinks and printer stalls). This error occurs during 1 sided prints also though the frequency is lower. The print quality is borderline average (just about). Also, since there is no LCD display (why I can't fathom) it is impossible to debug in case of network connectivity issues.
Would strongly recommend buying another printer, or in case you are set upon this one, I can sell it to you for really cheap so I can change the printer.",2
3246,504,Very good Canon printer,5
3247,505,"Canon G3000 this printer is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è and print quality is super and using the canon printer app it always easy to use your printer and its print on A4 , photo paper , glossy paper is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏èü§©I have tested it.
Best printer for home use for sure üëç",5
3248,506,"Amazing printer for Mac book owners.
It‚Äôs very easy to use and at the same time very economical too. The colour prints are of superb quality. Having this home is a blessing as a lot of time is saved in transferring your data to other devices. Eventually you save time and money both. Best product. Loved it totally ‚ù§Ô∏è",5
3249,507,10/3 %,3
3250,508,"Easy , just press and hold the wifi button and the power button blinks. Search and connect from phone using password at the back of the printer. Open selphy app and its done. You'll be addicted to printing mundane stuff.
Print quality is not bad and not great either. Its just acceptable.",5
3251,509,Product is efficient. Instructions for installation are not up to the mark. Had to rely on YouTube videos of unboxing and installation from third party to get it going.,4
3252,510,"Product is good, technical support is very poor. Installation almost take 3-4 days.",4
3253,511,not benift for the public uses,5
3254,512,Amazing product. I felt it bit over configured for home use before COVID. However during COVID time it has helped me and my family a lot. It is really useful. Ink last for long time. Easy refill and not expensive as inkjet printers. Worth buying it if you have school or college going children.,5
3255,513,Very very good product.,5
3256,514,"Big drawback, this product doesn't have airprint facility & it has not been mentioned anywhere in the product details/description. Color photo print is average & not as per mark. Product is only good if you want to print B/W pages. Frequent disconnections with net & takes considerable time to warm up",3
3257,515,"Very nice printer... Printer quality is awesome and you can print your own photos - no need to go to print studios. The engineering of the printer is ultimate.

it takes a little while to install and configure the wireless, though. Yes the tank ink reduces quite some the first time because of the ink flow into the pipes, but you shouldn't get worried.

It's only been few weeks... Need to check the cost of print, etc.",5
3258,516,It takes time to print using wire less ans sometimes the ink smudges on the other side of the paper other than that it great,4
3259,517,"Sometimes it does photocopy very slow,
still print quality is good. üòÅ",3
3260,518,Print quality is pretty ordinary and not of high resolution. Installation can be done by buyer without need of customer support by following the printed installation manual which comes with the package. WiFi is kind of ok. Need to deactivate data service on mobile if printing directly from mobile without any router. .. one good part is that it can continuously print for 10-12 hours a day without much trouble. Onsite support during warranty is available and generally available within 24 hours.,3
3261,519,For printing,5
3262,520,"Writing this review after one and half year of usage.
Worked well within a year of warrenty and then broke down after 6 months. Only one service centre across the state of Goa.
Repair charges 5060 that's almost 50 percent of the printer cost that too excluding printer head.
Very high maintenance cost.
Not recommend for home use.",2
3263,521,This Product is good,5
3264,522,"It's an ultimate product for print/copy/scan.Economy of ink consumption and hassle-free printing through usb/wifi is it's unique quality.It is really owner's pride and neighbour's envy. My kids are at cloud nine, as they are getting instant photos of their funny activities and thumbs-up from teachers for their colorful project work and homework. Kudos to Canon for such a wonderful product and of course to Amazon for making it available to customer in time and at Rock bottom price.",5
3265,523,Printer is Ok. Takes good amount of time to start print once print button is clicked. But main problem is Wifi set up. I still couldn't set up printer on my Wifi ( I am using TP link Deco M4). Instructions mentioned wouldn't help.,3
3266,524,Needs some time before you connect to your devices like ipad.. Read carefully manual and some online demos before starting and after that you can have infinite copies of photos if you have photo paper and colour printouts. Earlier I had catridge printer but tht used to give me trouble to fill ink and replace the catrifges often. Just used it for a month till now and liked the wireless connectivity as I can take printouts og photos also from my ipad without connecting wires.,5
3267,525,"The printer is smooth and the printing quality is nice.
Don't find any difficulty with installation (Followed the installation steps from youtube)
There are 2 issues:
1. The printing speed via WIFI/SELPHY APP is very slow, my wifi connectivity is good. Seems the issue persists with printer data receiver.
2. While installation/Initial Head setup, printer has consumed more ink from YELLOW tank. Almost 1/4 of the ink was gone during installation. But afterwards the ink usage looks normal..",4
3268,526,"There is nothing to dislike about the product yet. Someone stated that the Installation would be very difficult. Yet I found it to be very easy once I followed the installation manual that came with the package.
As for the print quality its really difficult to believe that I am actually taking a print from an inkjet printer. It was as good as a Laserjet printer. So overall its a superb product. Now just need to check its Wifi ability.",5
3269,527,"Loved the printer, initial setup was a little tedious but following the documentation helped. Print quality (haven't tried photos) is very good. WiFi printing once setup is easy to use. Since this is an ink tank print costs are nominal.. Very good this far..",5
3270,528,"Easy to install. Just follow the instruction manual. There are two manuals. One for setting up print heads, add ink in tank and then deleting up power. Another manual is for how to setup and configure with PC. The only difficult and tricky part is to set wireless mode with modem or without modem.

Print quality is excellent.",5
3271,529,"Its taken me a while and am still not able to connect this to wifi. Wireless printing via wifi is more secure that the second method they also show. Wish I had bought another printer

Update 2: was finally able to connect. Once it's connected, it works very well. The print quality is good. Files scanned can be directly saved on phone.",4
3272,530,"Installation is smooth, and no issues. Printing is satisfactory. No problems. We are using it periodically and no problems so far.",4
3273,531,"If this could been with double side printing then it could have been the best printer for home. even though it has latest future of WIFI printing from mobile, but not have dual side print will waste of paper.",3
3274,532,"Value for money but two things is bad.

1) Black color print is dull
2) Printing noise is disturbing",4
3275,533,I have registered a ticket with Canon helpdesk to send a tech to support the installation. So far no one has visited my place and technican have closed the ticket without notifying me. Send email to Canon but no response yet. They whatsApp helpdesk also not responding.,1
3276,534,It is a good printer. It is a little bit troublesome to install but you can manage it. 3 black ink and 3 colour has given in the box.,5
3277,535,"1. No information on yr of manufacturing while you purchase, the inventory was 10 month old stock which I could see post delivery.
2. Wanted help for wireless set up with iPhone from Tech support however never received the call back which they assured the same day.
3. Printer works ok",3
3278,536,Not really pleased with the delivery as it was delayed for 5 days otherwise the product seems good and working fine. Hope to review it after few weeks of usage.,4
3279,537,Good Budget Printer especially when kids are likely to stay home till vaccine of Covid-19 comes... lots of activity sheets would be needed.. and this printer offers great help..,4
3280,538,Had ordered it for my office. For a ink tank printer the print quality is decent. The installation was quick & easy and very well facilitated by the Canon team for free. Its easy to use and compatible with Macbook. Got two extra bottles of black ink. Good Value for Money.,4
3281,539,colour print is not good.. white lines are appearing,2
3282,540,"Wireless function is only available through their app . upto this date, I didn't found any other ways to connect printer directly from my phone.",4
3283,541,"Difficult to install, definitely wait for engineer for the installation. Connecting with wifi not a easy task, troubleshooting comes often, printing waiting time is too much, I witnessed very strange thing and I believe nobody talked about in Amazon comments section, canon app doesn't support word or Excel file to get a print though your mobile phone (android/iOS) but yes same can be printed from the laptop. Customer care service is pathetic they even don't know which application to be downloaded for print they are useless and not able to give a solution at all totally waste of time. I think made a mistake and purchased canon ink toner, I think HP printers will be a better call, I have experienced HP printers in the past with better features, seemless wifi, customer experience is good. Not Happy with my decision. Its your hardmoney take a cautious call while purchasing.",2
3284,542,"I'm writing this review after using this from past one year, printing quality is good, customer service is also reliable. Wifi feature helps in printing from different devices. Great product.",5
3285,543,"Really worth the wait! I got it for about 3,400 lower than the actual MRP. Received the printer in 5 days way before the expected delivery date, was not expecting that!
The printer is amazing, the black and white prints take about 7-8 seconds approx. Colour prints take a bit longer. I have also tried glossy photo paper and used it on ""bordeless mode"" which is amazing.
The best part of the printer is that it occupies hardly any space as compared to other brands. And plus you get 2 extra black ink bottles which ensures you will not run out of black ink!
Overall it's a really good product for the price I got it at!",5
3286,544,"For printing on the back side of the paper. I have to literally remove the paper and feed in again.

From mobile I have to connect to printer Wi-Fi. Lot of troublesome workaround.

If there is an option to return I want to change to other alternatives of canon.",1
3287,545,"Quality of 4""x6"" photos and the general documents is awesome.
Only concern is the number of prints that whether it will meet its promise of 7000 color prints but it won't be less than 2000-2500 prints along with so many photographs which is more than enough for me !!!",5
3288,546,"The packaging was bad. The product came to me with the packaging open. There were scratches.

The printer is good and i got two extra black ink bottles which will last for about18K prints. Print quality is reasonable good. No complaints on the printer side.",3

No reply from customer service",1
3290,548,I expected a small printer but it is some what bigger than they illustrate and the printer gives best quality printing than the laser printer and it is easy to setup initially I don't know anything about the product installation but they give a nice explanation how to do installation that's a added advantage. It looks pretty good and there are many other good also but it's enough here.,5
3291,549,It's really frustrating to use this printer. I am not expecting very high quality print from an ink printer but fed up with frequent ink dry up in pipes. Initially i was told that it is due to less frequent use but i am facing the same problem even after regular use. It's cartridge was changed with in six month. Please don't buy it for your peace of mind.,1

3384,642,"After using the product for a few days one day when I turned it on to do a print the error light and the power were flashing in alternation. usually when I turn on the printer it makes some noise. the head moves back and forth, and it sets things up for a print. This time there was no sound and only the lights flashing. upon checking it showed up as error B202. which requires you to call cannon and ask for a repairs. I was surprised to see this. the printer is just a few days old.

I tried turning it on and off a few times but it didn't work. then I pulled the plug, reinserted the plug and powered it on. and finally this time it made it noises and started setting itself up. I could use the printer for the rest of the day with out trouble.

but then the next day they happened again..

and then the day after this happened again.

I'm quite upset with this product. remaining all functions and print quality is great for office use. but if the printer doesn't work then nothing else matters. id like to return this product but unfortunately I've crossed the return window.

The unit shouldn't have been tilted at all. But the Amazon delivery person kept it sideways. This is absolute disregard to the product usability and negligent attitude. Amazon doesn't lose much if customers face product quality issues.

Also, Canon customer care isn't connecting at all. Also in the product creative on the Amazon app, HP and Epson customer care numbers have also been given under the same product. This is confusing and Epson Customer care has flatly denied that they dont do installation of Canon printers. Horrible experience.",1

3454,712,So far So Good.,4
3455,713,"I bought this in July 2018. And after a year of operation, it starting giving problem. Every time I needed to print it asked for cleaning which I thought was normal. And then after two years of operation its photo-copy scanner needed replacement which was about 2,700 INR cost. I thought it is a durable product so I went for it. Then came the shock, I found that even after part replacement Canon given zero days of warranty. And I realized why I shouldn't have gone for part replacement as within 6 months, the wifi chip failed along with the mother board.

And all this while from the 2nd year to the 4th year it kept giving problem, some time it will give no ink error, even though the ink tank was full.

And guess what, I was about to agree to pay 3,500 for wifi chip and main board replacement, when the engineer himself said, its better to go for a new printer than to stick to this piece of junk.

Better to consider canon only for DSLR cameras. Printers is a different ball -game altogether. Stick to printer companies, I should have listened to my friends when ending up buying G3000.

Also I came to know that its better to go for Laser than to consider InkTank - its just a jazzy name for normal inkjet - costs are anyways high, given the high cost of repair and the non-proven nature of technology over 10 years.",1

This is a printer from a reputed brand (Canon) purchased from a reputed platform (Amazon). I am appalled, to say the least. I strongly recommend purchase of electronics and appliances from stores and not from Amazon, and I advise everyone to stay away from Canon products, which become e-hazard sooner than you buy them.",1

3515,773,I connected my printer to wifi then I lost my internet access. What is the use of wifi with no internet access? All the documents are in the cloud but I can't print them without the internet. I have to download the document to my local phone then connect to the printer for wireless printing. This is not at all a wireless print option. This is misguiding and not worth to go with a wireless option.,2
3516,774,This product got delivered well before time. I had made a request for an early delivery.. Thanks to Mr.Amit and Mr.Khalid( Amazon Managers). They both made sure that I got the delivery early. I'm really impressed by Amazon's team work. The printer has been a quick and easy set up. Print quality is good. Go for it!,5

3525,783,"Frequently had to clean head. now suddenly showing errors and Help is asking for paid service including visit charges for the service mechanic. It is a VERY BAD machine. The ink consumption is low, but prices t quality is very very poor. It will require self cleaning again and again. Features like poster printing on multiple A4 papers are missing.
The ink tanks are still half full. We print a few pages a couple of days. So no heavy work. It just died. CAN NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO BUY THIS PRINTER. If at all buy from a shop or dealer. Amazon help is useless. I bought it on 16th April 2021. Today is 9th June. So it is out of warranty. It is a bad machine.",1
3526,784,Average quality product. No technical support after warrentty period,4

3532,790,It is a good printer in this price range,5
3533,791,"Satisfied with the product. Good quality print ,copy and scan. Better to take the help of company persons to install as synchronization takes time. Ease of printing due to wireless facility. Equipment is little bit of noisy and have higher vivration while working. Anyway, this doesn't affect much. Overall a good product.",5
3534,792,Print quality is poor not as expected.,3
3535,793,I have been using the printer for about 2 weeks now. It was fairly easy to setup and use. Have no issues so far. Then its only been 2 weeks so far.,4
3536,794,"While printing from Android application we do not get options to edit the image or document. Hence zoom and print , crop and print is not possible. There are no editing options in the application.
Also the first print takes considerable time. Rest after 1 week use there is no other functional issues. We can print over wifi from the application which is a advantage.",3

3541,799,Good quality printing easy to use recommend to buy,5
3542,800,"The printer is good. But I‚Äôm seriously concerned about the outdated software it comes with. It‚Äôs just too difficult to install to get it up and running even for a software developer.

I‚Äôve also noticed some security flaws
* The windows and iPhone software are pinging to some unknown Chinese servers constantly
* The app mandates opening firewalls without which you cannot even use the Printer.
* There are some rally outdated libraries used in the software (2005-06)
If you are a bit security conscious, stay away from this model and go with a Non-WiFi Printer which can be connected via USB and uses OS certified drivers.",1
3543,801,almost a year is gone. And no problem face at all. only precaution is regular usage ..ink consumption is very low.colors are good.,4
3544,802,"Issues:
1. Wifi only in name. No real wifi support.

3551,809,Writing this review after 3 months of owning this printer. I use it at home for mostly printing documents. This printer is well suited for that. I also tried printing some photographs but they turned out very grainy. So not ideal for photo printing.,5
3552,810,"Wireless printing works well. A few options to edit or select multiple pictures and manual duplex is required on the Canon Selphy app.

But very cost effective (after months of usage)",5

Things to note: wi-fy feature of this canon G3000 will only work if you have Wi-Fi modem.",2

3570,828,"- Good print and scan quality.
- One star less for the cumbersome wifi setup and usability.
Also connectivity fails at time. Primary reason for purchasing this printer was for wireless printing.
- Lack of on-device display is a downside for printer worth around 15K.",4
3571,829,Thanks to amazon for such wonderful printer in reasonable price. Received it yesterday and same day installation by cannon representative. With the help of wifi it is Easy to use. Print quality is too good. Printing photo is wonderful. Till now no problem... happy with printer at such low price of rs 8999.,5

3580,838,I received the printer in given time. The setup is easy and the printer and scanner is working fine. The quality of scanning is very good. The printer is silent and the quality is crisp sharp. I have been a user of Epson printers from past so many years but this time i must say canon has come with a good quality product.,5
3581,839,"Zero tech support, no installation; the number given for installation does not work",3
3582,840,Easy to print by USB but not able to connect through wifi.,4

3586,844,Slow but works very well...for fast printing go for lazer printer,4
3587,845,"Brand new printer. Installation intructions totally inadequate. Diagnostic and error messages are useless. When one of the ink tank component did not seat correctly, the error message was misleading. Had to call tech support

Now I changed WiFi password at home network. There is no easy way to reconnect.

I connect it to using USB.. printer is not detected... I printed about 50 pages so far and it's not usable as I cannot even connect it. Cheaper printers from Samsung I had which are 1/3 the price were far better",2
3588,846,"It cost me INR 13K for this printer, but realized it was a waste of money just 1 month into owning it. It's wireless connectivity is a hit or miss most of the time and the printer frequently shows that it's Offline even though the Wifi LED on the printer indicates a good connection. Then we've to reboot it 2-3 times to make it work. Even when it shows Ready, it frequently hangs with the error 'Port is in use', whatever that means! Sometimes even when it's Ready and Connected, it doesn't print and just does nothing as if it's not receiving any signal !! Print quality is also sub-standard for an Ink-Tank printer. It does not even support Automatic Document Feed for 2-sided printing. Nor does it offer any AirPrint support for printing from Apple devices. Total waste of money !!",1
3589,847,"Print quality, both color as well as b&w is very good. Printer speed for b&w is pretty fast though it is but slow for color print. It should be more than sufficient for home usage. WiFi connection is additional advantage. Printer design also looks good unlike Epson printer.",5
3590,848,Inferior print quality. Very very slow printer.,1
3591,849,good printing .The only thing i don't like You will have to turn off your Data connection and connect to the printer through its own wifi.,5
3592,850,Product is good with wifi connectivity and tank is also big. Inky tough is connectivity and first time installment. Rest and overall product is very good.,5
3593,851,Excellent printer with beautiful and crisp prints. Being the wifi printer it's so easy to operate from anywhere if there is proper wifi connection.,5
3594,852,Been using it with mac for about 3 months....printer works excellent and print quality is excellent and I love the scanning options...canon has done an awesome job....if your planning to buy a printer under this budget...I would definitely recommend you this printer,5

3607,865,Excellent printer. For installation Canon Engineer came and fixed it ( I sought support from Canon toll-free help desk). Print can be from laptop via wired and WiFi. Also from iphone and Android phones using WiFi/ WiFi direct. Received 3 color and 3 black ink bottles. Suggest to keep the printer near WiFi router for fast printing. Using 75 gsm plane paper.,5
3608,866,It's s very good printer for everyday use. I have purchased it for printing worksheets for my younger one and is functioning as expected.,5

thanks. CANON",5
3637,895,"They give you 2 extra black ink bottles, but the printer can't print black if color tanks are empty (not joking). If you print infrequently, then it gets jammed and won't print.

For the price, this is a fantastic printer.

+ The ink refills are reasonably priced. The printer comes with a full set and an extra black ink refill.
+ Manual duplex works well, which is a great help in saving paper.
+ Draft mode prints documents rapidly and they are very readable even with the lighter printing.
- The scanning quality could have been better. Photo scans lack finer details though document scans are fine. It doesn‚Äôt pick up colour gradations as well as we would have liked.

They will blame the ink is duplicate ( i bought it from amazon with registered dealer ). Or we have to replace this part and that without even looking. I took a cloth and cleaned the head and everything was working fine.

First, it has issues with MAC. Installation is painful.

Then it has a special app that you need to use on mobile phone.

Then it just flat out doesn't work with Linux.

Then setting up wifi printing is painful.

Just walk away pal.

And oh, darker images have parallel lines through out the page.
And also, it cannot duplex print from Mac or Linux or Android (not sure about Windows). I think its hardware cannot support.
And also, scanner generates potato quality scans.

Just bad! Money loss.",1

3964,1222,Printer quality is very good,5
3965,1223,This is the worst printer I have ever used in the last twenty years. The ink assembly pipe clogged up in a month and colour print stopped working. Canon believes in forgetting the customer once you buy the product. Please stay away from this company. You would be better off with a HP product or Brother. The extended service warranty is a scame. Use your hard earned money wisely,1

The quality of print outs are good.",5
3981,1239,After sales support. Not compatible to all the routers. Connectivity issue keeps popping. The tech support team of canon will say router has an issue. And when you change the router the same issue keeps coming. Again the team will examine and say router has an issue. Canon tech support team will never admit that product has an issue. So if you are bold enough to deal with the new sense please buy it,1

3988,1246,Super,4
3989,1247,Never recommend anyone to purchase any product from Canon that too via Amazon. Both organisation in terms of customer handling are worst and worst.

I also have difficulties in selecting grayscale or colour while printing from mac.",1
4006,1264,Canon service is very poor . Nobody comes for installation of the printer . Canon call center is very rude and no solution will be provided at all,1

4018,1276,"Printer installation and maintenance. It's costly to buy and costly to operate.
This printer gives bad quality of colour print as the printing head seldom gets choked with dry ink. Only option is to daily print (even if you don't want) or print head cleaning which wastes considerable amount of ink. Not preferred at all, I will not buy this again. Rather would be happy with any cartridge based simple printer",1
4019,1277,Prints a lot of pages with one full ink tank. The Samsung customer service technician team is also very helpful. They helped me with an issue I had with scanning and it was very quick. Definitely recommend.,5

4057,1315,After using for 3 months I can say Printer is a pain when you actually need it. We have to keep resetting its wifi it disappears from its app by itself. After doing all the circus and getting it to work it will print few pages and suddenly stops pro ting and throwing messages like the printer is busy. I will not recommend this printer to anyone,2

4060,1318,Good prodect,4
4061,1319,We had a epson l365 earlier and were not happy with its print quality and cumbersome wireless options. If you print after a gap of few days epson printer would need a print head cleaning before use to ensure good printing. All these problems are solved with canon g3000.,5

4074,1332,WiFi connection is intermittent. I tested it with Airtel and Jio Router. Printing stops halfway due to no connection with Router every now and then. The biggest problem is it scratches the paper while printing. See the pictures attached. Folds the corner of the paper.,1

BEFORE BUYING THIS PRINTER CONSIDER THE ABOVE.

THE RIDICULOUS REDUCTION IN INK LEVEL OCCURS DUE TO

OR DUE TO USING ALREADY USED COUNTERFEIT CATRIDGES

MAJOR CAUSE IS INK DRYING, THAT WILL HAPPEN EVEN IF YOU BUY FROM OFFICIAL HP STORE

ALMOST 50% OF ALL HP INK CATRIDGES REVIEWS TELL THAT

SO IT MEANS 50% chance that you will recieve a catrige that will print 10 pages rather than 60 pages

IT IS BETTER IF YOU SEE THOSE REVIEWS FROM AMAZON YOURSELVES, INK COLOR 805, 805XL, TRI COLOR AND BLACK

After printing 5 glossy paper color photo ink level of pre-installed catridges reduced from 100% to 20 %

Photo print max resolution 1200 x 1200 dpi

Uses tri color hp 805 and black ink

4790,48,"This printer is amazing. It does high-quality scans, copies documents significantly faster than some of the older devices, and the print quality is impressive.

But.

The cartridge runs out before you even know it. I understand that this is a problem not only with HP printers but most of the printers available in the market, but, HP to follow the same razor and blade module is so not okay.

The cartridge runs out extremely fast, and you have to change it before you have even got a chance to play with your prints. The cartridges are around Rs. 800 each, so I don't think if you print regularly, this is the right one for you. But if you are like me, who only uses the printer for home purposes, then yeah, go for it. This printer is amazing and does what you need it to do.

All in all, the decision is up to you. The cartridge runs out fast, but the printer is super convenient, and the prints it gives are of high quality.

Cheerio,

4793,51,"I have used HP printer in past but that was long time ago and now this is my 2nd HP printer. Overall the product is good at this price tag, but I am sure some improvements can be done to enhance user experience. Fit and finish of product is good and is light weight.
1) Installation software needs to be downloaded from HP website and installation is smooth. Software is not very user friendly though
2) I faced issue with my 1st print as after installation of software it was just not printing. But later is started printing after a reboot and about 15 mins
3) Print quality is ok and bit slow, as we expect from a Deskjet printer. (Please don't compare print quality with Laser printer)
4) Scanning is good, scans perfectly but its slow (specially with high DPI). I faced one issue with the software wrt scanning. I can save a PDF with multiple pages in 200 DPI but it does not work with 600 DPI. Maybe HP can provide a resolution or improve the software
5) Last but not the least, Ink cartridges. I am sure these small cartridges with the printer won't even last 100 pages. Most of my printing is black, but even a black one will not last 100 pages. So buying new cartridges at 600-800 per piece is a rip off. Better deal with refilling to have economical printing

Overall its a good product.",4
4794,52,"I bought it this year in Jan, and I am regretting it...so I am writing a review to stop others from making the same mistake. Don't get fooled by other reviews or 3 star rating, you are just paying for a plastic box that's it! If you are lucky and it is printing then guess what it will print only 10-15 pages with the official HP ink cartridge. So if you take a print from a shop you will have a much better quality and still save your money! The worst part is customer support, the numbers mentioned on documents and the box in which it came, DO NOT EXISTS anymore! I tried getting the customer care from the vendors, even they are not able to reach HP customer support. Their website is designed to help all other customer then printers...it is complicated to find service details other than software tutorials for printer...there are limited authorized service center in Delhi for printer and guess what where there are...on the edges of the Delhi...you have to carry this whole damn box all the way to NCR. I am an IT guy I usually fix printer issues on my own like connectivity , driver missing etc...but this printer is evil at it's core! All the ink levels are full, latest drivers are installed and still it will print a blank page every damn time! Why? How? And which machine takes hours to WAKE UP! I literally have to wait for hours before it gets ready to print a single damn page.

PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!",2
4795,53,Excellent,5
4796,54,"It's been about a month that I'm using the printer and have printed about 140 pages. My reviews are based on the usage in this short period. Hope this helps.

Use: Printer is good for normal home use.

Pages/cartridge: With the cartridges supplied, one can print just about 40 pages (not 100 as mentioned/advertised).

Cost of printing: If cartridges are replaced each time, the cost of printing is too high (something like 19/- per page for b/w). Simply refilling the ink is far economical.

Printing quality: On printing quality, it's better than average. As mentioned, good for home use. Print in draft mode. For pages <= 70 GSM, printing back-back is not advisable. It's traces are visible on the rear page as well.

Printing speed: It prints slightly slow, this being an ink-jet. That's fine and expected.

Features: Prints, Scans and Copies. This is kind-of basic model, so no features such as automatic double-side printing. That's known and is fine. It goes well when more than one page is placed in the feeder. With a single page, it needs to be inserted in the slot till the end below, which isn't easy...and the page usually get's stuck while printing. It's advised in the manual to use multiple pages in the feeder (manual is not a part of the product...to be searched/downloaded online).

Handle with care: Parts are delicate, need to handle with care (especially while removing cartridges to refill).

Overall: At this price, it's good to have.",4

4801,59,Printer is very good for home use. It is light and is easy to set up and operate. ONLY DRAWBACK IS THE COST OF COMPATIBLE CARTRIDGE HP 803 which is very expensive. A combo of black and multicolor HP 803 cartridges will cost you around *1500/- (for 2 cartridges) which is more than half of the cost of this printer. Hence i didn't give 5 star rating.,3

4808,66,I am using HP Printer for last 15 years and prior to buying this printer I was using HP 1510 Deskjet All in One Printer. I found that this printer is quite intelligent as it understand more formats (like if you take screenshots and paste on the Word Page it seamlessly prints that including same quality in Color) etc. It also intelligently sets the color shade better than the previous one. But the Print speed is very slows as compared to the 1500 series printers.,4

*I reccomend to buy a more expensive printer, as the experience will be better and you can save money on ink.",3
4819,77,"Print quality is satisfactory, as this was for casual home use. Setup is easy as only the cartridges provided need to be installed. Need the HP Smart App on laptop for using the printer. The printer is recognized immediately on connection. The app shows how much of the cartridge colour/black is left. Taken about 15 black and white prints and the cartridge capacity has come to 50%. That was expected from the setup cartridge provided and hence one star less as more life would be better, hope new cartridge lasts more. I would recommend this for casual home use. Direct printing from phone would need an OTG dongle on phone and the HP Printer Service app from Playstore.",4

4827,85,"HP DeskJet 2131 All-in-One Printer is a simple and reasonably priced product of HP. It is a good choice for personal use if you don't need bulk printing.

Here are my observations:

1. The product was shipped to me on time without any hassle and follow-ups.

2. The packaging was impressive, and on unboxing, it did not give me a shock. The product was brand new, without any damage.

3. Its assembling is little tedious. I would advise you to go through the youtube videos and the manual carefully before start assembling.

4. As my laptop does not have a CD driver, I downloaded the printer driver from the internet. I checked printing of a color page and it worked perfectly.

5. But the cartridges are small, and it consumes a lot of ink, so printing would be damn costly for those whose intend to use it for bulk printing.

6. I liked the white color of this printer. It gives an elegant look.

7. Another nice feature of this printer is its all in one [printing, scanning, and photocopy] facility. It makes it a good choice.

8. The product is not robust. You can realize it while assembling the printer, so if you plan to purchase it, make sure you will have to handle it carefully.

9. There is no wi-fi support, and it is a big limitation with this product.

Overall verdict: Reasonably priced and a good printer for use at home.",4
4828,86,"It gets very high costly after the long time becoz the cartridges which are used instead ink have high price ....

4835,93,"If you know how to remove a few pieces of sticky tape and follow pictorial illustrations to slot in the ink cartridges, the initial setup is easy. What is not so easy is getting HP's Smart App to work. It's an utterly senseless interface with ambiguous prompts and instructions. Once you have figured out that you don't need to 'add' the already installed printer, then you run into a regularly freezing app. Thank goodness for Ctrl-Alt-Del. HP offers no advice or good solutions for their Smart App's freezing problem. There is a workaround though, which I finally discovered after trying umpteen number of things. Terrible terrible 'Not-Smart' app. Print quality is OK. Scan quality is poor.",3

4839,97,"Printer is ok for those who are economically well to face heavy maintenance cost. I could print only 80 pages (b/w) with the provided cartridge. I realised that it is not meant for me, so i returned it immediately.

Pros
1. Comparatively cheap cost printer with AIO features
2. Good printing speed with medium quality for home purpose
3. Quality scanning and functioning

Cons
1. Heavy maintenance cost (especially for cartridges, you have to pay about Rs. 769/- per cartridge)
2. Colour fades after few days
3. Colour print is not up to the mark
4. Ink refilling is an option but risky (lasts maximum 3 times per cartridge)

Suggestion
1. Better go for ink tank printers, even though initial cost is more - profitable in long run (if you print atleast 300 pages per month, then compulsorily go for ink tank)
2. Take care in case you plan to refill the ink, it may damage your printer as well as void your warranty",3

Never ever in ur life ,even if by mistake dont think about buying this inkjet or deskjet type printers of Hp.Hp is chinese.and we know china and chinamall.
I dont know about ink tank printers but yes this type of inkjet is a total waste of ur money and time.

My hp 2131 printer lasted around 3 months only with so many messy things ,
Printed 40 pictures with the demo catridges.
Next 300 pages with refilled ink of good quality.
Now both of color and black catrige doesnt recognizing.

New Catridges cost 1900 around. That is insane amount compared to printer cost.
Hp suggests always replace catridges after single use(40 photo printing-1900rupees).they wont even listen or attempt to repair if there is other faults otherthan catridge unless u buy new catridges of 1900.

Then why the hell will someone buy this costly catridge rather not throwing the machine in first place.we do not have money thats why we came to this cheap price.

You may try inktankbut again that is also fitted with so many chip components and i doubt hp set some type of firmware there too,but laserjet is defimately best option for a cost effective and long run printer.
so at the end i am going with CANON LB2900 as it is long lasting and made from Japan.
Previously i have a canon inkjet ip1300 .that has been working for 10years .trust me.
So Canon is a good choice.hp may have more service centers than canon,but what if u cant get the service out of that.
Nothing is more than costomer satisfaction.

So u may try canon inkjets.but i personally recommend always go for canon specially laser printers.",1

It is written that the cartridge can be refilled but in reality the printer don't accept refilled cartridges be it black or colour. First printer and it's worst home printer.
I had tried contacting customer support but what they say is just buy new cartridge.
It's cheating to say that each cartridge can print 200 pages but I had already refilled 3 times and haven't even printed more than 300 pages yet. And now it's not accepting a refilled cartridge . DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. It's a review after the product has been used for 3 months.
Edit- It had been 6+ months while I'm using this printer. Do not buy this printer, to be precise I got a fresh cartridge of both colour and black ink, printed only 61 black and white prints and only 3 color prints, black ink cartridge is empty and color is half empty, last color cartridge also finished with just 4 color prints.
Can't refill, can't keep spending money on useless cartridges.

4863,121,,5
4864,122,"First of all, hats off to amazon for delivering the printer 5 days before the expected date. So, no complaints about that.

About printer, it looks stylish. It is very compact. Looks great in white color. This is my first printer and I bought it for home use. It serves the purpose very well. The installation is very easy. It works like charm. The hp software is very idiotic. It says connect the printer, even after taking prints from Microsoft Word, scanning from the 'Devices and Printers' options in control panel. It worked means the pc recognizes it, but the idiotic hp software doesn't recognize it. But you can always get your job done from control panel, so I don't care about it now. The controls are very intuitive. So, go for it if your main purpose is for home use.

I wish I could end up here, but unfortunately NO! It uses HP 803 cartridge. And it is too expensive being tri-color at 949/- and black at 799/- !! The page yield for tri-color is ~165 pages and for black it is ~190 pages. It will empty your pockets like nothing!
I'm thinking to refill the cartridge instead of buying a new one.

So, final verdict. If you are ready to spend this much amount of money on cartridges, then surely go for it. Otherwise, go for 2135 Ink Advantage. I wish I would be known about this at the time of buying. 5 stars for printer and 3 stars for cartridge.",4

it takes too much time to print anything.

4933,191,"I have all HP computers in the house but despite that faced a lot of difficulty setting up the HP app and syncing up with the printer. Wifi connectivity still doesn't work. Mostly thankfully you don't need the app for printing but it is unfortunately essential for scanning so I have been able to scan from only one laptop in my house
Printing is very slow and the colour printing was pretty bad after some 15-20 pages itself. B/W is also low already and I've barely printed 40-50 pages - printing with a strange reddish color now",2
4934,192,"It's a all-rounder printer, I've read many reviews about this one, mostly negative but I want to clear the air coz I've used many printers and have good knowledge about the same.

Caution: If you live in a dusty room or anywhere there's dusty environment that impacts printer, these small printers are dust sensitive and can be damaged easily(especially the scanner bed) with ample amount of dust, so to protect, either buy a printer cover(the plastic one) or create a 2 layer DIY polythene printer cover by yourself this will ensure no dust enters any vent of the printer and maximize its life and keep the surroundings of printer clean so that it stays safe and gives you consistent good quality prints and scans.",5
4935,193,Print cartridge not working. It is taking only black cartridge and for color it is not recognised. Every time we need to remove and keep the cartridge to take the print. Can someone help what to do in this regard. It gives error printer cartridge not working,3

4937,195,"The printer is working perfectly fine and the quality of the print is really awesome the only drawback of this printer is the cost of the cartridge. The combo of HP 803 costs around Rs 1500 which is half the price of the printer itself. Moreover, the cartridge does not last long for 100 pages the maximum pages which can be printed with a single cartridge is 20 pages.

I would recommend not to buy this product unless and until you wanna spend your hard-earned money lavishly.",3

Printer driver is not provided along with printer and",1
4942,200,"total waste product after 2-3 months it is not able to print
cartages are very costly",1
4943,201,"Things I want you to know:
1.It is not cost effective for long term.

Reason: The cartridges which they give (1 Black and white, 1 Tri-Colour) are not at all sufficient. At max, you will get 50 best quality printouts or 70 Draft/Normal printouts .

2. You need to buy extra cartridges which will print around 190 pages and will cost Rs.755/- per cartridge. Just keep this point in your mind.
3. In my case, the same day, the printer arrived, after printing 5 pages, all the lights started blinking and I had to lock a complaint call to HP. The technician came after 2 days , applied white grease , dealt with the cartridge placements and repaired the (new) printer!
4. You must take the extended warranty for at least 2years, coz you shouldnt rely solely on the guaranteed product.
5. The print quality will vary according to cartridges. But I must say, go for the wifi enabled printers [which it isnt].",2
4944,202,"After using this printer for more than 3 months , i would not recommend this to any one. This Printer cost is less , but the main trap is in the cartridge capacity is less & cost. Every 10 days you need to refill this cartridge's. Which is too costly .

I would not recommend this for school work ,as well as for office work.",2
4945,203,The ink cartridge for this printer is only upto 240 pages. This is not enough for small businesses. We in our company we take nearly 200 pages printout. The ink provided is for only small amt of pages but costly in price. so HP can improve their ink to nearly 1000 pages.,4
4946,204,"Extremely good product , I bought with an offer and got Keyboard free at same prize. Yes printing speed is very fast and if ink is over use youtube videos to refill the same cartridge and it will be like 0.01 rupees per page cost for printing.",5
4947,205,"The product stopped working in 10 days now It's been 1 month since I'm chasing HP Service for repair/replacement.

They just create a new ticket and ask to wait for 24-48 hrs for a technician to visit.

I'm still waiting for a fix.

I made a mistake, please don't buy this if you want to save time and energy.",1

The printer is awsome didnt need any software to install to my window 8.1 pc it was plug and play.
The print quility is very good
Printer is silent
Color prints are good
It took almost 12-13 seconds per print b/w
And 20 seconds for color ( depends on the image )
scan quality is awsome super detailed when done on 600 dpi
xerox is also of good quality but i think it has a shorter scan while photo copy because i did few and noticed that the bottom of the page got cut out
Few buyers would say that the print cost is high but thats only true when you buy new cartridge every single time when it gets run out of ink, instead you could buy a set of ink of prodot under 350 rupee you will get 1 b/w 100ml and 3 tri color ink 100 ml each.
you can fill b/w ink cartridge upto 20 times by that means every single page would cost you only 1.5 to 2 rupee
And thats cheap
Otherwise its a nice budget printer for personal usage",4
4955,213,"ABOUT THE PRINTER:-
user-friendly, medium-sized not too big or too small. good for desk and personal use.
2 ink cartridges come with the printer. it's a light lavender coloured printer which I love. there's no printing paper with it.
HOW TO INSTALL:-
so I am writing this because I myself had never used a printer in my life on my own.
1. remove the covers and plastics and the cardboard inside protecting the ink slots. adjust the paper alignment (the paper alignment bar can be moved to adjust) and close the inner door from where the print will come out, only open the outer door.
2. connect the wires to your laptop/desktop and go to the website provided in the pamphlet.
3. follow the instructions from the website and you're done!!

This printer is just for scanning and printing few papers and not for heavy use.
Print quality: good but not for heavy use

My review on this product after buying it.

Product name:
HP DeskJet 2131 All-in-One Printer

Product after use:
I have purchased this Printer and it was amazing after unpacking, it was delivered what i saw in image while purchasing.
I am using it till now all looks good and perfect no complains till now, my suggestion this is very nice product for home use.

Advantage:
- Small and light weight
- Two cartridge available
- Easy refill of cartridge
- Easy installing new cartridge

Disadvantage:
- Bad if not used regularly
- Inks dries if not used for long time
- Need to replace cartridge if not used for long time

If you are planning for Printer at home so you can buy this product.

The tech team and the seller should take care of this feature when its availing to any of customer its getting automatically adding two quantity in the cart section, I was usually do double check but I missed to confirming this time. My bad! Amazon tech team is also not ready to help me out. They saying that as per our policy is not allowing us! I'll tell one thing Amazon team! ""Policies are only made for product not for humans' tech activity mistake!""",2

1) The printer is ok but it is for today's times.
2) Ultra basic.
3) The cartridges last for about 60 to 70 each with medium usage.
4) No mobile connectivity.

Please try going for the ink advantage version of this model which costs between 5500 to 6500. But the best deal would be to save some money and go for the epson ecotank.",2
5002,260,Worst printer in the world ..... like throwing your money in the garbage not even 1 star ..... not able to connect in laptop / mobile tried everything .... the ink that came with it was over in 1 day after that again I purchased a new ink but its not working complete waste of money and on top of that these shameless HP support people won't reply to your calls / mails /tweets no customer support at all want to return this garbage,1

Based on my observations, I can say that -
1) Printing speed - 7/10
2) Print quality - 10/10
3) Command (how fast it catches the commands) - 9.5/10
4) Durability - 9/10
5) Scanning - 10/10
6) Functioning of buttons placed on the printer - 10/10

One more thing that I can see on this printer that it will not catch the paper on the tray if only one is placed. You have to manually press that single paper so only your printer will recognize it.
Otherwise everything is good.",5

5012,270,Some times the printer dint work. While some times it misprinted. But i would say it's ok. The most disappointing thing is ink which is very expensive. U can go for it but i will suggest look for some other brands. Small review after months of use. Not good for intense use.,3

We bought it in diwali offer. For this much lesser price , the printer is working very very nice. The quality is so good. Thanks to Amazon and HP. I bought it for my dad while I use another HP LaserJet p1007 printer. Both the printers r working well.
Initially I had little problem in installing this deskjet printer to iball 8"" tablet PC. The printer model/ type was not showing initially. But the problem is rectified now. Still I have to find the way to ""scan"" the printer in the tablet pc even after installing the HP smart app. I don' have much time.
Still I have yet to try the cloud printing or it would be better if HP helps to make work the scanning function. The other 2 functions (print and copy) r working fine.

Amazon as a feedback please add a tag on this product that cartridge is non- refillable. I never faced any issue in whole span in 6 to 8 years in shopping with Amazon still i would say its best.

4. Double side printing is not automatic. Need to manually feed the pages back to printer if we need printing on both sides of the page.
4. Copy (Photostat) functionality is good. Can copy both in color and black&white.

This is very good printer and print quality is awsome but its printing price is too high so if you thinks that you can easily refill cartrige forgot about it is rejected by printer once you refill using suction tool and other etc you have no choice you have to buy new cartidge which price 1600 for both ... because after refilling printer reject the cartidge and you cannt use it again ...it is completely use less ..

My advice is to buy a inkjet tank printer which can esaily refill..
still i m using it is not for heavy duty it is for less work i m student so its good for printing front pages of my assignments ..!
It will print 70 colour pages and 160 black and white pages .. esaily loving it ..",4

However the Installation instructions sent with it were perfunctory in the extreme, and merely pictorial. I had to guess the sequence of several operations, and be helped by a relative with experience of a similar device, in order to get the printer operative. The ""Instruction Book"" sent with the item is similarly next to useless. For example it does not instruct how to adjust features of the machine such as brightness, contrast, colour temperatures; it does not instruct how to deal with usual malfunctions such as paper jams and power failures; it does not even instruct how to invoke the scanning feature.

If someone buys printer it is sure that one would never print a page or 2. I am extremely displeased with the product as i believed in hp products... so if you have to print 1 or 2 pages you can go for and then also 1000 bucks for 40 pages is the worst investment you'll ever do...",1

If you want to print a pictures it prints just 4-5 page & cost of cartridge is 1200 so cost per page is 300 rupees, when I bought this printer & printed 4 pictures on A4 size pages and my ink got over I thought you I don't used cartridge and I ordered for new one & after installing new one I printed again A4 size picture & checked cartridge it because half.
HP don't even allow us to refill if we refill our cartridge then our printer will not have warranty so if you are only black and white printer then buy then one but for colour printing don't buy this better go to cyber cafe and print what you want or buy laser printer never ever buy inkjet printers for colour printing.",2

-Works with OTG cable in Android (However you cannot adjust the print size or quality. It just prints a single image on full size page)
-The software immediately displays the ink levels as half empty even if you just printed a single page.
-Ink is too damn costly.

If you have an occasional use of coloured printing, go for it. It's the best in price range. But for regular use it'll put a whole in your pocket.",5

Yeah, the cartridge proves to be very uneconomical; So better if you refill the catridge at the right time( when the ink level is low but not dried up )... I suggest you to get a prodot ink bottle and you can easily fill upto 20 times..

5168,426,"First one delivered was used and broken, but the seller exchanged it the very next day with a brand new one.
Printer is working as expected and the quality is good.",4
5169,427, Quality bed,1
5170,428,"Easy use, easy to refill ,",2
5171,429,Useful,4
5172,430,"1) It has ordinary print Quality
2) You can only print upto 100 pages from one cartridge.
3) Print speed is also slow",3
5173,431,Catridge provided with the printer while buying print very less page. So due to this I have to again buy the catridge which is cost ly. So I will not value this printer as good buy.,3
5174,432,Super,5
5175,433,"As I need to take occasionally print out for sons school assignment during lock down, buying printer itself is good option. Overall product is good and didn't face any issue so far. 45 days completed for purchase. Manual given for all steps with product and still u can do ur own r & d to operate. If u want to take print from mobile, purchase otg cable in advance . Easy to use overall and print quality is satisfactory.",5
5176,434,Please work on the catridge thing,3
5177,435,"Super

Thank you Amazon",5
5178,436,At this price is a good product but print speed is very slow and color page print 50 black page print 70 and (photo only 2 print than inked is a very very low amount showing),4
5179,437,Useful all in one printer,3
5180,438,"Its good for home use only, that means if you don't need a regular use of it.
Its is absolutely not economical for regular use since cartridge is of high cost",4
5181,439,Good quality product,4
5182,440,printer driver software cd missing.,3
5183,441,Pls do not buy this machine..it's pathetic..maybe HP other models are better.. paper does not feed smoothly especially single sheets. Printing sequence is back to first ..and before the year is up the carriage has got spoilt which means we have to throw it as the part costs as much as the machine. Not one single print out was a pleasant experience,1
5184,442,Not compatible with MAC but its a value for money if you are using windows laptop or pc,3
5185,443,Cheap price but expensive maintenance. Cartridges are very expensive and prints very less pages.,3
5186,444,"For the price, its a good entry level printer scanner that should do for most general home, small office requirements.",5
5187,445,"It is a very basic instrument. Ideal for a couple who do not have heavy print load.
The print quality is good and very easy to install and operate.",3
5188,446,"I sincerely regret purchasing this product. .there is a major flaw in design it self. Only from one side paper support is there in the tray. So there is no proper ""driven in "" for paper into the printer. It is drawn into the printer from unsupported side it goes on an angle. So print comes as spoiled. I talk to Amazon person they told only replacement is there for this printer ,no money back(may be because HP aware about the flaw in design) , they connect to HP support they told they will arrange a technician that day itself, but no one come for service until now(3 days). I don't know why a reputed company like HP is selling these type of products of no use & keeping their after sales support very bad. When you purchase a printer from HP ,please think twice",1
5189,447,The printer is easy to use but it stopped working within 2 months. I tried to connect to customer care but no response yet. Don't buy as HP service is really very poor.,2
5190,448,"Installation took bit time, but give tangible output",4
5191,449,Product is nice one no doubt about it and very easy easy to use. Print out a bit costly as per print cartridge cost. But one we are using for home use and every now and then print out is not required so it worthy in this view. Print and copy quality is beautiful only thing you have to use original everything...hope you understood. Rest all ok. Very easy to install.,4

5203,461,"A best budget segment printer. Definitely go for it if you are planning to buy it for home usage, it is not for business purposes. Cost of ink cartridges are very high and outcome is about 50 to 60 colour pages and about 70 black and white pages. But print quality is really outstanding no one can beat it within Rs 10000 price range in terms of print quality. Must use normal 75gsm a4 paper or higher standard papers for best results.",3

The print quality is awesome for colour and black and white print both.
We never used printer before but installation was very easy.
Yes, print speed is bit slow but we don't need to open a shop, in 3400 INR it serves more than it needs to be. Scanner is awesome and fast too. I am truly satisfied with the purchase.
It is being used frequently by all of us in our family.",5

5208,466,"Should not be bought. Low price and print quality is very good.The on.ly problem is that it is very costly, and the price of a cartridge is Kala-750-800, on the other hand the price of a color cartridge is 900-1200 and from that black print will give 70-80, i.e. 70 √ó 2 = 140 rupees is being printed.üò†üò†üò†üò°",4

No idea about the ink
Still for this price it's okay",4
5210,468,it is a quality product comes with a trial colour and black white catridge . it was very light weight then any other hp printer. i recommend you for home office or personal use. but little bit slow in proccesing files to print. the user interface is very easy and simple. simple bw print button or colour print button and a cancel button and resume and ofcourse a power button. a cd with driver comes so you can install the driver first for use . you can also download driver from hp website in support section.,4
5211,469,"Absolutely easy to setup and use.
Brilliant product by the good ol HP",5
5212,470,Good but it ink consumption is very high and it is better to say print is cheaper than ink also its scanner quality is not so good if u r buying for scanner purpose than buy 5500 hp printer i am using it too,4
5213,471,easy to use and budget friendly,5
5214,472,Simple in installing and good print.,4
5215,473,Overall It's a good product,4

5219,477,"Only prints out 50 pages with new cartridge. Refilling is very difficult these days as the printer is out of fashion. Better prefer tank printers instead of this.
After refilling it prints out 5 pages only.",3
5220,478,Everything is good but 4 star is only for scanning as u cannot scan more documents continuously and if u do so u lose everything u scanned and u have to start again.,4
5221,479,As of price the print quality is not that good. Also print cost too high. But it's really easy too install... Overall you can go for other printers.,3
5222,480,"I have took three prints until now (all black) and they all are dark and legible. There is no flaw with printing as such, However, the scanner is not working when attaching the device to the laptop.",4
5223,481,"I usually don't write negative reviews, because I don't like to spread negativity. But I absolutely had to write this review to let people know NEVER to buy this piece of junk, even by mistake.

It prints exactly 4 - 5 pages with every refill, and that's it!

Yes, its that pathetic...

1 printer refill = Rs. 800. So essentially, you're paying Rs. 800 for 5 pages of print.

HP should be ashamed for selling this piece of crap in the open market.

NEVER buy this piece of crap, even if someone gives it to you for free.",1
5224,482,"If you want a cheap moderate printer then its ok. Keeping in mind to use for 2 to 3 yrs of moderate usage as catriges cost sky high.
Else go for tank printers if you want high usage at cheaper cost.
Think thoroughly before choosing.
Goodluck.",4
5225,483,"I struggled with the installation as the drivers don't get installed automatically. Even after downloading it from hp website, the hp smart software was not able to detect my printer. Had to take support from hp tech support.
Other than that the printer is superb.",5
5226,484,"A fantastic printer for this price.

You can only use this for your homes.

Keep it to yourself if you run out of ink in it.

Buying a new cartridge can be expensive.

My mark 70%",4
5227,485,"I like everything in this printer but the real reason is about disliking this product is not imtge printer but it's cartage system it's very much costly you could even buy a new printer if you wish to buy two three sets of new cartage don't buy this printer if you wish to print economically don't take this printer even you if you want to print 1 or 2 prints because that will even cost you more than 10 or 11 rupees per print so don't buy by another type of printer which do not use cartridge system if you want to print economically

Press the helpful button if this review was helpful for you",2
5228,486,This could be only used for few prints. Then it's ink gets over! Then u need to buy that for more than 1400 rs!. It's a waste for me now.. No replacements,1

Even if we try to fill the cartridge with the ink, the pages turn out to be blank or void of the respective color. Hence, the cartridge has to be replaced again, which makes it very costly to maintain.",3
5238,496,"I just want it to perform that is what l want, rest it is beautiful",4
5239,497,Although the printer looks good n has good printing quality but the cartridges received with this pack doesn't work for a month and I had only taken out 15-20 pages. It's cartridges are very expensive and dries off quickly if not used regularly. When I reach out to customer support I didn't received any help regarding the same which was extremely disappointing n not expected from Amazon. Atlast I would say buy on your own risk n don't expect any customer support,1
5240,498,It prints only 100 pages... So printer is good but its cartridge is too costly. U need to expense 700rs per 100 pages.,3

It's ink cartridge is very less and is for sometimes use!!(less use)
Really easy to instal and it has a problem MAJOR
u have to change the settings of paper size
Hope makes a sense",4
5244,502,"If u have enough money and no mens to use that money then buy it, and waste all ur money by spending on the costly ink-catridge. If you try to refill it with other ink ur catridge will get damage someday. So my suggestion is not to buy it. I should research on it before buying it. Anyway it's now a decorating item in my room since I can't afford that costly ink-catridge.",3

Installation is done by me using old cable, printer working fine no problems there.
WHY IS IT NOT POSSIBLE TO EXCHANGE CABLE ONLY? don't want to return whole product waste time, and had disposed of the original packing.
Strongly recomend anyone, not to accept product if not in amazon packing, think this was my problem.however was in hp packing and sealed, but who knows who is responsible? all i need is a cable, price on amazon approx 1500, printer cost approx 3000. ""crazy""",2

Also its cartridge is small and pages printed are less compared to others.
Black ink got over within a month only without using that many pages mentioned on the box!!",4
5255,513,"It's definitely worth buying this printer especially if your needs are relatively simple. This printer is essentially a simple all in one printer with copy, print, scan features. The printer comes with HP Inkjet cartridges. You have to feed paper from its back. It's very easy to use once you've done the setup right.
There's one pain point though i.e. the printer does not come with any software disk. I had to search online and download the right printer driver for my PC to make it work.",4

The product (Printer) is good and worth of money. I think it will be one of the best available for this price. The only cons I notice is it produces little bit noise during printing otherwise perfect. I get all the accessories as how it would be.

I recommend to for this who is looking for a printer within this price.",4

As soon as I click on print it took around 30 minutes to print one page. Had to return it for refund. After doing some research I found that printing black and white print can take upto 45 mins a side and it‚Äôs effective only wen used Color prints.,1

Now in the present situation of Work from home condition it is good fit. Do not take much of space, easy to set up. Ink cartridges are costly. No installation CD or support is supplied with the instrument. One have to download the driver online. That's become a big challenge sometime. Aesthetics and Printing efficiency are good.",5

5339,597,"Looks good , prints well but there is a big problem in the way it pulls in the paper.

Didn't expect such substandard quality from HP.",3

5349,607,The printer called is very best than compared to 10000 worth of rupees printer and I am using the printer for my life time user can have that why because the printing called is superior than Canon laser are made any Epson printer I am using the cartridge buy refilling the ink by injecting so the print rate for each black and white pages but at least 10 piece just timepass only and the colour print called as a 25 may be when you are using refilling the cartridge through injection so I already purchased some of ink refilling in c m y k from your Amazon website they also good everything is good regarding this product I give five out of 5 marks,5

5351,609,Printer is gud to print documents but the colour printing quality is not up to the mark if you print a picture it will be blurry and u can see pixel.,4
5352,610,Ink is very costly,4
5353,611,"Please read till end , trust me please don't buy this , after one cartridge is empty if 164 prints are done from one cartridge it will show empty cartridge and one cartridge costs 1200 and if you use this printer so rarely the ink will dry up or if you refill an empty cartridge it will not print anything and buying new cartridge everytime it drains up it will cost you 2400 per month , it's better to buy a expensive printer rather than buying a cheap hp one and later knowing we were scamed it and even now you are not convinced than try printing some images of 2K and above it will print them near to 720 p there's no reason to buy this awful thing",1

5358,616,Quality Is good but cartridge ends within 80 pages after installation also cartridge is very expensive not good product as compared to cost,3
5359,617,Everything thing is okk but you have too buy a cartridge after use whose cost is near about 1800 so it's too costly.,4

5365,623,"Have been using the printer for about a month. It's very good for home use. I'm sticking to original ink cartridges for the time being as the refill procedure provided in the after-market cartridge and ink seemed too cheap and prone to spillage. Even otherwise, original cartridges are easy to use and affordable for home use, when you consider the trouble of going to a shop to get printouts and the cost you pay there.",5
5366,624,"It is not compatible with Mac OS, works flawlessly for Windows.",4

5371,629,"This product does printing and scanning well. Works as expected. Main problem comes is the ink cartridge. If you shop online original cartridge, it costs ‚Çπ800 and more ( for small black catridge that yields just ~190 pages ). That's more costly if you are taking more print out or copy. If you take less pages and do scan, then this is good for you.",5
5372,630,Very bad product after 30 pages it does not taking the pages inside when I called customer service they specifically said ink is over I have to buy new cartige 1 is cost almost 700 so the total cost is almost 1500 for 30 page print ...its huge very costly na not convenient at all,1

5379,637,"Paper feeding is worst, printing both side is complicated",3
5380,638,"I dont know why people are writing negative reviews about this product. This is purely for occasional use at home. The print quality is amazing (both b/w and colour), easy to set up and use. You just need to download the driver and all set for use. I will recommend this product for home and occasional office usage. Best product in this price range.",5
5381,639,"It is simply impossible to understand as to why HP cannot create a simple installation system. You have to first download an app which then refuses to recognise the printer and keeps asking to ""connect"" the printer when it is already connected! In three days after delivery, I have somehow managed to install the printer on two laptops and still waiting for HP app to work on one more laptop. All in all, utterly third grade product. I had canon printer earlier which was fast easier to install and operate. Not surprisingly, HP has named its printer driver as ""HP Smart"" - it is the dumbest app around",1

5387,645,Good for basic printing purposes.. does not support printing from mobile using OTG,3
5388,646,The scanning resolution is perfect and printing output is also good. The only problem lies with paper input tray. while pulling the paper inside sometimes the paper gets jammed.,4

And after filling it also goes to empty after 60 pages and after filling again it was not doing the printing so I have to order a new cartridge worth 717 and then after 60 pages it again goes to empty and the printer is not doing well and taking out only empty pages ..... Totally waste of money .... I prefer not to buy this .....",1

5403,661,"Printer is good.but the only problem is with its cartridge and its printing cost,this is not a good choice for anyone,the new cartridge gave just 80 pages black print and vanished. New cartridge cost around Rs 981. So just calculate the printing cost is about Rs 12.25/page. So i don't recommend this printer for any purpose either home or office use.",3

The best feature is that it's 3 in one printer which can print, scan and copy. The thing I didn't liked much about it is cartilage which may dry up so you need to use the printer in every 2-3 days. All the cartilage can finish after printing 100 pages. It's good for those who use it for personal home use.",5
5423,681,Overall is good in price. But ink get finish after 100 pages so u have to be prepares for ink.,4

5431,689,"The product is worth its price, But, one negative point is the higher cost of printing because of less number of prints per cartridge. Refilling can be done to the used cartridge, but the result is not always good.",3

And this printer and its software will not be allowing you to refill the catridge. other brand low price catridges will also be not accepted by the printer. You must buy original 803 catridge of HP. Don't think that you can do something with youtube videos and will use the printer by refilling catridge or something. The software is unbreakable.

so it's really costly right? you can easily get print from outside in 2/3 rs per copy max to max.
So my final suggestion would be if you are looking for your printing requirement and you think that it would cast less from outside, then you are wrong, for scanning you can go for it.",1

But inside I checked with manual Ashwell as cd installation which has been mentioned hp 2130 series

Very poor quality and inbuilt.
I can't able to detect which product I got
I think I fake one
Then I checked the product of scanning procedure
It's very very slow and the colour printout has no perfect quality

Instead you can get print out from shop where atleast they will cost you 1 or 2rs. After printing 80 pages you have to replace the ink cartridge which will cost 1000 rs.

It is very easy to install the printer alongwith its cartridges. Its looks are superb. Printing quality is also great (I have attached the snapshot of sheet that I printed just!). The scan feature is just rocking because it works very fast. But the printing quality should be improved.

With the company provided catrdige, you would be able to hardly print 15 to 20 sheets. If you do not use the printer even for 2-3 days, the ink will dry and you will have to replace the cartridge.

Each catridge would cost approx 1000 and you would be able to print max 90 pages and each page print would approximately cost you 11 Rupees, which is very bad.

I sold this in OLX for 1.5k and brought a ink based printer from Epson for 6.5K. This printer prints 6000 sheets for a catridge worth 500. The cost of each color print would be approximately 18 Paise.

This aio printer comes with demo cartridge which hardly prints your 50 pages.

Now usually people go for refilling. On each refill it prints at most 100 pages either color or bw. So you will get refill cost of ‚Çπ0.50/page for bw and ‚Çπ1.0/page for color. But now there is as a trick, this refill idea will not stay long. After 2-3 refill your cartridges stop functioning and there you go... Now new cartridge costs you ‚Çπ800 each. So not advisable for higher print counts.

Now it's not even advisable for lower print counts because you have to print one page a week to avoid ink drying.

Better go for CISS printer",1

In turn they advised me to contact local service centre of hp for replacement. Surprisingly HP service centre denied any replacement of cartridge as it‚Äôs setup cartridge. HP seller has not informed that printer will be delivered with setup cartridge (limited print capability) and we have to by normal cartridge additionally. It‚Äôs unethical & not expected from hp,1

2)printer is not a brand new one,its a product returned by someone..we can clearly see the invoice of others..
3)both the ink catridges are missing from this peice.

Or, If you are thinking you will refill your cartridge then you can't, because HP Smart app will deduct that cartridge and you can't print with that you have to purchase new cartridge after printing 50-60 Pages.

It will cost you much much higher in long run after 2 to 3 years if you compare between (both cartridge-printer + all the cartridge you have purchased) and (inktank-printer + all ink) you will find out ink tank is much cheaper . Better go for inktank. Never think you can refill and use old cartridge HP blocks old cartridge after it's ink get empty. Printer will not detect refilled cartridge.,1

7242,0,"This printer is excellent in terms of functions and usability. Three features that sets it apart from comparable HP printers are duplex printing, ease of printing directly from a mobile device and the cost of cartridges. Expect these to add to convenience and economy.

Couple of negative points:
1. The paper tray protrudes out. It is OK while printing, but when it is not in use, the paper tray lid can not be closed with paper in it. Paper capacity of the tray is also less compared to HP ink advantage 4625 which I had earlier.
2. Printing speed is quite slow in both b&w and colour compared to the HP 4625. However, it is OK for home printing.",4
7243,1,"If you are purchasing it for your home use, don't look any further. It has got all the functions you'll find in a 20-30k worth printers. All in one includes print, scan, copy and fax as well, Colour, adf, duplex printing, wifi. You download the app in ur phone and give print commands via mobile itself. Only two issue that I faced, firstly the print quality(which I'll speak to the service center) and secondly is the total quantity of color prints. I have only taken out couple of color printouts bad already the level of ink is 90%. I guess I'll have to purchase a larger cartridge.",4
7244,2,"I bought this item in August 2022, and the delivery and packaging was as good and sturdy as I've come to expect from Amazon. Using the printer from my Macbook is a breeze over wifi, although printing over wifi from Android requires some poorly designed app from Canon and has no direct support.

The only couple of issues I faced with this printer were during setup.
1. Scanning the qr code for the setup guide didn't actually lead to much of a guide, rather a boilerplate page. I would only much later find out the way from that page to the actual guide. Canon could do a better job of surfacing the online guide, as the image clarity in the included hard copy is quite poor.
2. Installation of cartridges seemed to take forever - I must have removed and re-inserted them almost 5 times before they were properly detected. No error messages showed up, and I didn't know if I had recieved a faulty product, or if I was doing something wrong.
3. Never having owned a printer, and always using either copy shops or the huge laser printers at work, I ended up making a mistake in setting up the paper tray, leading to a jam at the first print itself. Thankfully it was straightforward to open up the printer from the back side and remove the torn pieces. Canon could do a better job of demonstrating how to set up the paper sheets - clearer access to the online guide might've helped here.

Except for the these minor concerns in setup, I'm enjoying using this printer surprisingly, since printers (alongside projectors ) are usually the worst items ever developed by the electronics industry. I've used all the features so far - print ( colored, double sided), scan and copy and not faced any issues with quality, wifi or the cartridges.

7246,4,"Cannon E4570.
This was launched as a successor for E4270 (I searched everywhere but couldn't find a credible source to explain the differences between the two). I researched extensively before purchase to find a printer which will fullfil the following criteria for me - wifi enabled (so that we can print with smartphone without opening the laptop), clear color print (decent for child's homework, photo quality not required) and cheap to run. E4270 seem to fit all the criteria, so I ordered this. Even the canon authorised showroom didn't have E4570 in stock, so ordered the E4570 off Amazon.
Summary - fullfills top two criteria. Though is a little expensive if you do more than the occasional print.

Delivery was 3 days earlier than the delivery date shown on Amazon, so that was great. It was just the printer box, with no outer packing. The box was sealed with cello tape, and not sealed, so I suspect it had been opened at some point. Thankfully, all the components were there, and the seal on the printer and cartridges were intact, so i was ok with the delivery.

Setup was smooth on both my smartphone and laptop over wifi. I never had to use the usb cable. Setup was through the canon app on phone and the canon website (link for both given in manual), which guides step by step on how to setup. I did not face any challenges and the setup and printing has been smooth from all devices.

Color prints are a bit faded on plain paper (75gsm). This might be a function of the paper and not the printer. The black&white prints are crisp and sharp. The print speed is decent.

The only negative is the amount of ink consumption. While the box says 180 color prints and 300 b&w, both my cartridges are showing at 80% after 4 color print and around 30 b&w. Specially for color prints, the printer tends to drop the cartridge level by a notch after just 2-3 prints. I suspect the color cartridge will not last longer that 30-40 full color pages. Refilling the cartridges a few times is of course an option, but it is messy and requires practice. This is fine for me as I need color prints very rarely.

A special mention for the ADF and duplex printing. Both the features are extremely useful. Duplex printing is especially unique in this price range, and comes in very handy while printing larger documents.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase after couple of weeks of usage. I will update the review if I run into any issues.",4
7247,5,After 20days of usage ..I'm unable to print as it is showing black ink running low ..i have print only 100pages ...and in description they told that 400pages yield thats totally wrong,3

7251,9,"Good printer but
-Even if u print in monochrome it uses colour ink.. meaning even if u print in b&w it still uses a little colour ink
- U can't print if one of the ink is empty both have to installed and full( in my hp inkjet printer It prints even if i remove coloured cartridge)
-bought the one with smart speaker for 8300 which is overpriced it is available at 7500 usually.. wait for the right price dont get scammed.. (without card offer)
Positives - ADF and duplex function
Print speed- decent could have been faster if i was printing in draft mode(hp is faster in draft mode otherwise regular speed is same for both)

Wifi - U can print directly from ur android phone even if u dont use any special canon software

If u can get an hp inkjet with wifi and duplex function in the price range go for it otherwise this is the next best thing.",4

I could be wrong but the wobbly ink compartment leads me to believe it was probably a returned item (unlikely to be a manufacturing defect). The photo print quality is passable for small images in documents, b&w is adequate. Installation was straightforward, configuration on IoS & Android phones and laptops was great.

I have been able to scan and print on legal size paper also, though this size is not specifically listed in the specs. So far, duplex printing has not worked well. Paper gets jammed at time of turn-around to print the second page. I suspect this is due to the quality of paper available here in India.

Surprise, surprise ... just couldn't set up the wifi connectivity.
Firstly, the set up instructions are incomplete and if one goes through the manual, the QR scan takes you to youtube videos which is not helpful at all.
Secondly, during the setup, which I tried with my MacAir, it keep saying that please check the code sent to your machine or mobile to continue. There was none sent to me on my MacAir, none to my email address and none to my mobile ... how could they when I had not even set it up? So... couldn't continue.
Thirdly, I went to the website given in the manual - ij.start.canon ... useless. The model number is not even present.
Fourthly, went to the Canon India website ... again no model. The closest was E4270 while the printer that I purchased was E4200. Downloaded the driver & wifi setup ... went through the procedure ... THOUGH LUCK!!!
Fifthly, wanted to return it ... couldn't; the option for return was not available ... I had to book a ""SERVICE CALL"" for someone to come and set it up for me.

MORE SURPRISE ... the technician called up asking for directions and finally never came. When I called him way past the allotted service time, I was told to send a video of the printer because it was a connectivity issue and the only way to rectify it was to get a replacement for which he needed the video.

I have sent the video and as I waiting, I got a mail saying that your service call has been completed ... please rate the same ...

I am at loss of words.

I placed a service request with Epson Service Centre, in less than 24hours, a technician visited my house, installed the appropriate printer driver (I had chosen a broader one) and solved the issue! The print quality is fantastic, whether for home or for small office, this is a very good choice, indeed! Go for it! üëç",5
7295,53,"--- Update 11th Aug 2021 ---

Printer stopped working after about a year. It stopped accepting paper. I've cleaned the feed roller behind the tray and the transfer roller accessible from behind, yet to no resolve.

The canon onsite technician visited home to take a look. Tells me the problem is with the paper pickup assembly and not with the feed roller. Charged Rs. 650 in service fees without spending even 10 mins to check the printer. He said I should bring the printer to their service center but assembly related issues can rarely be fixed. Instead they may try to give me a replacement printer for a discount.

The printer has no dust deposits outside or inside and has been used about 20 times so far for help with a 10 yo kids homework assignments and some photo prints. I only used original ink cartridges which were replaced once so far.

I am writing this to help you decide whether owning a printer vs getting your prints from a print store nearby is a better option for you. I feel like unless you want to frequently (more than four time a week) need to take printouts without which your work cannot proceed, you should avoid owning a printer.

--- Original review ---

I am a veteran IT worker, have used numerous MFPs at work over the years. I always admired features such as duplex printing, ADF and scan to email in those huge expensive network printing machines.

Now you can enjoy most of those features (and more) in home printers such as this one. The printer was fairly easy to setup, and I started printing over WiFi using my laptop AND my OnePlus phone, in no time at all. I also use the printer to help my nephew with his homework assignments and so far everything has been working great.

I even took some prints for photo frames etc on glossy photo papers and those too turned out fabulous!

The printer is well worth the money and the ink cartridges can last adequately if you take the time to learn how to use it properly.

Quick tip 1 - The better the quality of printer media the better the print turns out. So make sure you use good quality paper when you expect the best quality print; whether for photos or regular document prints.

Quick tip 2 - Make sure you know how to use photo editing software to get the exact size of print outs you really want. If you use A4 sized paper and mistakenly print a 4x6 with borderless printing, you will end up wasting a lot of ink, for a picture you may not use after all.",1
7296,54,Easy to Install - Nice Product - Money Worth,5
7297,55,I liked the product but it has some merits and demerits as well first of all priter is easy to use and does not need any laptop and computer for priting and scanning you can use your mobile phone for printing and scanning. It takes time to get settle down take more time than usual if you are printing through computer or laptop. Cartridge ink is very costly. You will get black cartridge at Rs 649 on Amazon and 899 for colour cartridge. My opinion is average for this product. But good product at this price.,3
7298,56,"Within few months it lost the clarity and the alignment was becoming poor day by day ...but I adjusted.. because it cost less compared to other variants..so, I cant expect a far high quality ..thus I used it...but now its not getting power ON.

Special mention to their customer service...it's amazing...they have even whatsapp support.
If it is for home and your usage is max 5-8 papers a day , you can happily opt for this.

Tip: The obvious mistake I did initially was feeding a slightly folded paper... which damaged the belt of printer as paper used to get stuck inside printer. So make sure paper you are feeding is plain.",4
7301,59,Print/ scan,4
7302,60,"Updated review after 3 months of usage :
‚Ä¢Too high printing cost.
‚Ä¢The installation is good but wifi print is easy to set up. Your device and printer need to be connected to same wifi thats all.
‚Ä¢The package was not well packed with bubble covers. However they kept brown paper of 1-2 meters in the amazon box along with the printer box.
The piece is pucca and new. So the seller can be trusted.
‚Ä¢Fax option is good for the price.
‚Ä¢The print quality is good but takes lot of time to process and print it.
‚Ä¢My previous canon printer process late and papers get jammed often. Same problem is seen here.
‚Ä¢Cadrige and all stuffs are verywell packed. The cadridge can be refilled with syringe either by yourself or any local refill shop. But it runs out very quickly. Thats too bad for emergency uses. You should buy couple of cadridge as you never know when it'll run out. For me it hasn't even took 50 papers (of written documents) for full refilling.

‚Ä¢my opinion : i regret buying this. Reading all good reviews i brought this crap. I honestly suggest you to not buy this.
‚Ä¢No canon inkjet printers are useful for home purposes.",3
7303,61,Nice Quality print,5
7304,62,Printer set up is little difficult. Once you set up u can print from device on wifi without any app. Print quality is good. Black and white draft mode great action for reducing ink consumption. Draft mode print quality is good. ADF is working great. Yet to try out colour printouts,4
7305,63,"Bought with ease but couldn't install with ease... First the software installation said couldn't install because the current operating system doesnot support...

As long as it is installed I was fine... he turned up within few hours of complaint even though I'm in a far interior town in Tamilnadu... He installed it successfully....

Finally my suggestion go for ink tank printer or laser printer for more efficient printing cost.... These type of ink cartridges is of no use, catridges are expensive and prints less pages.... The printer is cheap because people no longer buy ink cartridge printer... I didn't have the knowledge , atleast you don't make this mistake....",3
7306,64,"I don't have regular use of printing. And it does the job just alright when there's need. It's been a few months and now the paper feeder has started having problems.

Pros - Cheap, duplex works fine, haven't tried the feeder from the top, fax, or anything else but I'm pretty sure those functions would do well as well. Direct Wifi works flawlessly. Having multiple ways to connect kinda makes it confusing but works smoothly.

Issues - (1) It doesn't take in the paper no matter what I do, unless I actually force the paper in when the feeder rolls. I've cleaned it, used less paper, more paper, new paper, old paper. I have to push it in.
(2) The ink is kinda expensive. It doesn't really cost as low as whatever the description will say, but having a printer at home is about saving time and ease of use. So, doesn't matter that much to me.",4
7307,65,"A product that deserves 5 stars, however there are a couple of points that are really annoying. Two outstanding features of this product are viz Auto Document Feeder and Auto Duplex Printing. Both these features work like a charm.
The LCD screen and keypad, both of which are of importance should have been ergonomically placed rather than the awkward position that they are in now. Also the LCD screen should have been bigger and backlit.
Print quality is superb for B/W and colour prints.
I am using the printer with native settings
hence ink consumption is a little bit on the higher side. Also ink cartridges are a little pricey.
Initial setup was quite annoying as Canon seems to have forgotten to mention that the printer needs to be first connected to the Wi-fi network to function correctly. Setting up the printer was a good learning experience for me.",4

Today was informed by canon service center that this pixma E 4270printer parts are not available from canon to fix the power on issue. Do not recommend to buy this product for this reason. Otherwise it was user friendly and easy interface at this price point. Convenient wifi printer.,2
7309,67,"For starters, installation was a cinch - started with the mobile. Worked flawlessly over wifi on mac, iOS a d android devices.

It takes a few tries to get the ADF scan to work well, set the paper guides correctly and it does a good job after that. If the correct size isn‚Äôt set via the guides, the sides could get chewed up and the scans would become angled.

Dual side print worked well. Again, it‚Äôs important to get the setting of the paper width / guides at the right position. Once this is done, papers go in smoothly and get spit out well. Interesting, the prints come out in the reverse order, unlike other printers. If you‚Äôre someone who wants to read as it comes out, you may have to wait until the end.

Canon has done a fairly good job coming up with a home printer with these features at this price point. No wonder it‚Äôs not easy to get your hands on this printer easily.

While Ink Tank printers are good for larger volumes, for someone who has a need to print a few pages randomly, this may be a good choice.",5
7310,68,A line is coming in prints if ADF is in use.,3

7313,71,"‚úîCanon pixma 4270, the printer that I bought for home use particularly for my baby. Hence, on that point of note it's more than sufficient.
‚úîI'm using windows 7 ultimate 64bit software (ofcourse outdated) for which I couldn't find the given CD useful. For me installation was really difficult perhaps, I should update my OS to win 10.
‚úîConnection via mobile was super quick
‚úîAll you gotta do is download and install canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY from play store (android user) that's all, printing is that easy.
‚úî Along with the printer they provide us with 2 ink cartridges, CD and a user manual. I just followed those instructions from the manual and few YouTube videos
‚úî Be it Xerox, scan, copy, duplex print or photo print it does the job for the given cost. Bought it on Great Indian Festival Sale for 5200/-
Update:
‚úî The cons that I found was the ink cartridges doesn't last longer as they quote. I printed less than 50 copies even before that it shows 25% of ink. Pathetic!
‚úî Dear buyers, invest 2k more and opt for an ink tank printer

It supports all the functionalities that is required for home use. The best features are, WiFi and Auto feed.
The driver is available online. I downloaded from net and installed on my Windows 10; very easy to install. Android app is also easily available and easy to connect with the printer. Got the print out and scanning done from both pc and mobile phone.
Few reported issue with page detection, I also faced the issue first time. But, got rid of it once went through the instruction.
Print quality is Ok, as I set the quality as *Standard*.
Need to find out solution for the expensive cartridge :)
I guess Canon provided driver for Ubuntu. But, did not find any driver for Rpi platform for Ubuntu.

7325,83,"Writing the review on receiving the product. The printer was super easy to install. Took less than 5 minutes to download the app and set it up. Supports AirPrint so I can now easily print from my iPhone. Print quality is good and speed is okay ( faster than my previous hp printer but obviously not as fast as a laser printer). Offers auto duplex & auto document feeder making printing work so much easier and hassle free. Cannot comment right now on the economy of the cartridges, will have to update after a few months. However, one con of the printer is that canon has not supplied the manual. Only a few pages mentioning how to set up the printer have been supplied. What is the use of having a great feature full product if I don‚Äôt know how to use most of the functions! One has to download the detailed manual from their website.
Edit (after 2 years usage): The printer ink is very costly and runs out after a few prints. Refuses to print black and white pages if the colour cartridge is running low (even with a completely new and full B&W cartridge). To top it off, ink cartridges are not easily available.",3

7337,95,"I bought this for some light printing at home - the Wifi function is quite useful and does away with the need to connect the printer to a computer, although it does take a few more steps involving installing an app on your smartphone etc. Wish the LCD was backlit since it would have aided visibility during installation - minor quibble only because the printer was placed in a corner without much light. Haven't had to use the LCD after the setup. Printing in draft mode is quick and uses less ink. The ink consumption is slightly on the higher side - not such a big deal since replacement cartridges are on the cheaper side. For higher volume printing, I would suggest going for a Brother monochrome laser printer which will be much quicker and with higher yield per toner cartridge.",5

Therefore, the only way to connect it is either using USB (non network mode), or using Wi-Fi. I am using the latter, and I have constant trouble in finding it on my LAN computers. Its almost useless for me now as a network printer. My suggestion would be to go for a wired LAN printer for anyone who needs a network printer. The scanner works and quality is ok, but works only when triggered from computer (I had to install NAPS32 software for this); one click scan from MFP didnt work. Haven't tried other functions, so cant say about those. For the build quality, its plastic and is poorly built (the trays have a lot of wobble), and paper alignment will therefore, always be a challenge. All in all, if you want something not too expensive, plan on using it without network connection at one location only, then this may work. If you want something that works on a network, and can take care of a home/ small office print/ scan/ copy needs, I wouldn't recommend it.",2

1. Printer itself good but not worth it
2. I printed 35 color and 34 black pages and my left back colors is already shown in this picture
3. Color cartridge is completed and have to pay ‚Çπ750 for buying a new one which can print again the same amount of 35 pages and need to buy again, again and again ....?
4. I have applied for refund and Amazon had accepted my refund application so I will get refund in 2-3 days, so I am waiting.
5. It‚Äôs not worth for anyone even for people who use it once in month since with one color cartridge it can take only 39 maximum pages with medium picture quality
6. My suggestion Go for INK TANK printers as you can save lots of money in Color cartridges.

7388,146,"I got it a month ago and use it once in a while. Setting it up was easy. They have a bunch of youtube videos for setting up each aspects of the printer. I like the two sided (duplex) printing and the multi-document scanner both of which are features you see only in high end printer. Some of the parts may feel a brittle, but honestly they are fine as I rough use mine and it still looks intact. The print and scan quality is good enough for a home/ office use but might not be enough for a high def printing or scanning.
Overall, this is an economical and excellent buy for a normal home/office use.
I am yet to check on the ink efficiency which I will update soon.",5

Can be used as a standalone printer very easily, with the controls

I have bought the printer for home usage, some basic printing for my son's homework, or my own basic printouts (tickets, forms, etc.). The first set of cartridges did not even go 100 prints and we had to buy new ink. Moreover, every now and then the printer stops working for very basic reasons. Papers get stuck or wrinkled or torn inside very frequently and then it becomes difficult to find the small pieces of paper which remain inside. I have an HP printer at my office, and frankly, though that one is costlier than this one, that one is also much much better than this one. The Canon printer has lots of unique features, Wifi-dual-colour, which is impossible at this price. However, what is the use of having such features if the printer remains bad for most of the days. I strongly recommend against purchasing this product.",1

Printing time's okay, printing quality is good on plain paper(have not tested printing on photo papers ). Amazon's delivery & packaging was timely and good. I would recommend this.",4
7433,191,Price worthy but within week I'm facing technical,3
7434,192,I bought this printer last month and from 1st week onwards it started giving issues. Called canon customer service and they told why did you buy this printer . You shouldn't have bought this. Not able to get issue resolved amd canon service is pathetic. Not sure what can be done on this situation. Feeling cheated,1
7435,193,Product is working nice. Print and photo copy both are good quality. Automatic printing is working well. Scan is not yet tested. Overall better than HP printers.,5
7436,194,Very bad quality,1
7437,195,Value for money . I would be happy if the ink catridge available at better pricing . More than 700 for a single colorinf may hurt home user .,4
7438,196,"I have ordered this printer 2 months back.
Pros:-
Printing on both sides
WiFi printing
Ease to use

Cons-
Ink cartridges are small completes quickly.
Print speed for color printing is slow",5
7439,197,"Printing cost is high . The printer is reliable , but the black PG47 catridge is 560 rupees and only prints around 60-70 pages , so printing cost is around 10 rupees per page .",3
7440,198,"Purchased this printer for my son, for his tracing worksheets, as I need lots of copies for same worksheets. The print comes ok but as I take copies it goes faded copy by copy. The technician took three days to come after following up multiple times after being purchased new and in warranty, and said, you have to take a colour copy of black & white picture as Black & white cant take grey colours ... how Amazing...and after taking colour print take colour copy not B&W, but after doing that way also it did not come so he said Madam it will come this way only. you need PDF to print, JPEG is not good to print, can't do anything. Now even after having an all in one printer, cant take copies of worksheets having dotted lines. Fully useless printer, waste of money. Feels like throwing it in the garbage as it's not serving the purpose and occupying the space. and the icing on the cake is you can print from your cell phone but cant opts for the option of duplex printing. The worst product I have ever seen as a printer.",1
7441,199,scanning is not good and printing off scan image is worst.,3

Couldn't install well even at the hands of expert and experienced hands.
Print quality is not good .
I want to replace this product.",1
7446,204,It is an all-in-one printer having duplex printout so like it very much. Moreover Canon onsite service facility is quite good enough to use it now and for my own requirement in future. Along with it is light weight easy to carry out.,4
7447,205,"Printer build quality and print quality are good. Very easy to install and easy to access it trough app.
But cartridges will not print more than 200 pages and refill cost 1600 for each set replacement.",3
7448,206,"I ordered it on 5 Jan received on 7 Feb. It was a used and defective product. As you can see open cartridge, finger prints on scanner, dirt all over the printer, scrambled mannual, leaking cartridge, multiple taping on the box to look like brand new, broken thermocol, just look at the packing of cables does it look new? And the cartridge slot was defective and wouldn't move a bit. At first I was told for the replacement and the pickup guy refused to replace and was asking it to be in New condition. What the hell? You have me used and asking me to provide new, what kind of scam is this. Then after so many complaints over call then also they were not giving the refund. But fortunately I spoke to one guy who helped me with the refund. Guys this was my experience with the seller ""appario"" something. The printer I was waiting for months have me a hard time.",1

And it helps me so much
It saves my time",5
7452,210,"It is my mistake. Despite seeing and reading host of adverse and negative comments, I decided to buy the printer. Installation was easy. Print quality is also good. Scan is working well. ADF is good. No issues for three days. From the fourth day, the printer started showing its ugly face. It refused to recognise the paper. Error message was repeating. Wrong size paper in the tray or please load paper. I wasted nearly three hours in my effort to make a print (single page). The printer simply refused to print. No other option, so decided to return the printer.",1
7453,211,It's very nice printer.there are many facilities in it.it helps when there is any problem in printer by giving one code .and if you search this code in google your problem will be solved.ex.my papers were trapped in the printer then the printer gave me code 5100 and when I searched this code I solved this problem.this facility impressed me.the printing quality is also very good.we can use this printer wireless so buy it,5

7457,215,"Print quality is good,easy to install,wifi printing takes a little longer .
Will give a feedback after few weeks of usage",4
7458,216,There's a ADF Scan issue as seen in the picture. Consulted with Canon Manager and executives. They accepted that this issue is there in this model and other models with ADF. So if you are planning to buy ADF then I suggest not to buy Canon. As its starts with small issues and eventually gives rise to bigger issues.,3
7459,217,As a product this one has all the requisite features which is why I bought this all in one printer however just that the print quality ain't exceptional..,3
7460,218,E4570,1
7461,219,Good product. Takes time to print for first time but print quality is good. Double side printing available. Easily accessible via my IPhone .,4
7462,220,"Well, this is a good quality all in one printer from a reputed brand for a very good reasonable price, print quality is very good, you can also print your photos, it just take some time to print depending upon the content of printing, it is highly recommended for home and small offices where daily requirements is very less like 25-30 pages a day as it doesn't print like a speed of laser printer",5
7463,221,The product felt very weak and fragile while I was un-boxing it. Rest every this looks fine and is good for home usage. It comes with USB and a LAN cable and also connects with WiFi so connectivity isn't an issue here. It would have been good if the printer came with a storage facility for the printed documents until the whole printing is done.,3
7464,222,Prints fast and easy to configure. However the quality of plastic is a turn off. Not for heavyduty print jobs. Also looks like the ink is depleting very fast. I have printed about 15 pages so far in economy mode and 20% is gone already. Buy it if you want to print a few pages occasionally.,3
7465,223,No installation supported,3
7466,224,"Easy to install, the print quality and speed were good too. We can easily connect the smart phone to the printer. Just follow the CD manual and its a breeze. The double sided print is very convenient and can save paper",4
7467,225,I am writing this review after use of 10 Days. Printer is good. ADF works very well. Printing from internet is also works. Duplexer is also very good. Print speed for black & white is about 5 sec. Till now I have taken around 60 pages and cartridge is showing 75 % filled. Only minor issue is with Print colors. Black is not black it's grey and color printing red is like orange.,5
7468,226,"Printer is good and printer body is wight less
Both side ADF not able to enable.",4
7469,227,The printer at this cost is worth a buy and the money spent is worth it....but paper gets frequently jammed which is a hectic problem ...and takes some doing to remove one....if this is corrected than its an awesome product.,4
7470,228,"Amazon has become the waste company that it‚Äôs not knowing what product the seller is stocking up in its platform. The product which I received is a faulty product with the power socket coming out and the printer cover/scanning cover was about to detach and fall out. Such a cheap product with cheap plastic components and cheap build quality felt like the product original parts were altered with duplicate ones.
2) Not all face the same issue but pleas do make sure not to buy these type of items from Amazon. Since I got no option of refund I had to replace the product with the same one and no option to chose a different one.",1
7471,229,"I like this printer. Specially duplex printing and document feeder is excellent.
After using duplex page scanning,it's exceed my expectations.
My printing volume is not large but may be cartridge cost is concern.

mobile and ipad applications are good and very easy to use.
compact design due to front feeding of papers and front ouput",5
7484,242,Firstly the print quality is not that great which wasn't expected. Installation is a bit hectic because it comes with a CD-ROM for installation. Wireless Printing performed well and also it prints fast enough. Built quality is okay.,3
7485,243,It's a very nice printer for your own use. Easy to install. Good to print less number of pages but if you want to print pages in bulk than go for another printer as it consumes much more ink.,5

7511,269,"Writing a review after a few months of usage. The quality of print is good, connects quickly to the wireless network, and the app is also a good addition to have. However, the print cost per page is extremely expensive. The cartridge promises 400 pages but it hardly churns our 200 in black and white. For colour, I have printed less than 20 a4 (no photos , only text documents with some colour text) and the cartridge is already down to 50%. Please avoid buying this and go for either a Samsung or a HP which gives you more bang for the buck.
For an inkjet, this gives the same number of pages as would any sub-3000 printer would give. So no point spending extra on the initial costs.",1

It does not have a space to store Papers. Every time you want to print, you have to stack required papers in the tray. Considering the compactness of the printer, this was to be expected.
It can print on both sides of paper, automatically. However for scanning or copying, I was not able to use properly; meaning I had to feed both sides of the paper manually.",5

Look at pics i have uploaded,
There many reason but i would enumerate only afew :
1 The AC power adopter got moisture and get burn itself .Its ok if it is one time replece . One. Can.manage but this is recurring phenomena .
2 if moisture is not enough to , there is PCB design of adapter . Look at pics only a simple pin connect the power jack with pcb if you press it a bit hard , it will crack and adapter become useless no power supply .
You have to buy adapter if available during this pandamic.

7673,431,"printing is poor and already looks faded. black and color prints are really BAAD! Brand new ink cartridge. HP print quality is WAY ahead! I now need to see the longevity of the ink. Ink got over already and hardly I printed 1/4th the number of copies as my HP deskjet. While the printer is quite modern with many automated facilities that HP doesn't have, it loses all its advantages to two things:
1) print quality
2) ink longevity, which translates to very costly print.

8120,28,"Everything is the best in this headphones, but yes the build quality could improve a lot.Otherwise the sound quality,bass quality,noise cancellation is all great in this price range.",4

8125,33,Total plastic material...,4
8126,34,"The product is good but the build quality is average. At this price range, this build quality is expected.
Sound quality is also good and I experienced noise cancellation.

We can't wear the headphones for more than 1.5hours. It starts paining after 1.5-2hours.",4

8130,38,"1) The quality of sound is good, and battery goes longer.
2) Mic not good, the other person cannot hear,
3) Feel bit tightness on head.
My old JBL 460T was far better here, no such issues. So will buy that again.

Good if you want to just hear the music, not good for office calls.",3
8131,39,"Sound quality, Bluetooth connectivity and bass quality are all good. It is light weight. Battery life is also great.
The only thing I didn't like about this product is that it's not very comfortable. The more we use it gets loose and slips of the ears as it has a plastic body.",3
8132,40,Well sound quality is superb for the price bass is loud but does not hurt ears or buzz at high volumes . Ear pads are very comfortable and soft can wear for long time . Battery life and charging I won't say as haven't tested . Only draw back is build quality is not that good feels like cheap plastic and also it's non folding so to travel either have to wear on neck or have to buy a case,5
8133,41,Overall performance is really nice üëç. I recommend you to order this product. Value for money. Bass is really osm in this price segment,4
8134,42,love how its lightweight ..it doesnt feels like you are actually wearing a headphone...the main problem when u wear it for a long time your ears will hurt from outside other then that great loved it,4

8142,50,"Very nice poduct but the sound I expected to be more. I expected to be more,the sound is ok amplitude is too ok but expected to be more amplitude overall bought it for 700 bcoz there was an offer in big billion days even you can buy to for 800 to 900.This is what I'm telling but normally the price is 1000 but after buying it for 700 I am wanting it for 600 üòÇ . go for it not bad upto 800 -900 rs it totally worth it.

This surely looks premium ny esthetics.
Cushion pads are very soft and comfortable.
Extension available as per your size.
While, you won't really enoy Bass with this.
It's amazing for soft songs, like some by Prateet Kuhad, while you relax in your couch.
But just maybe you won't like it travelling in crowded markets or so.

8207,115,"Hey there i purchased this headphones mostly for microphone and online classes. As microphone was my top priority I tested microphone quite a lot with bot pc and phone with some music during late night studies :)

Pros
----very nice microphone , the other person was able to hear me properly even if i was far from Device. One thing to note is when on pc you have to use AG handsfree calling mode not stereo else you won't be able to listen anything what other ppl is saying. Also ag is mono channel so it degrades sound quality which u get from headphones.But this isn't this headphones issue its just bluetooth mess which no one bothers to fix.

----battery life
Battery life is quite good tbh will easily last 3 4 days if u do mostly online classes and little music listening at night :)

----connectivity
Connectivity is pretty solid between the walls yeah bit struggles but considering how congested my airspace is with radiowaves blasting here and there connection was pretty solid.

Cons:
-----build
Build is cheap and hollow , i expect cheap but it feels like toy and not at all sturdy , so handle with care

-----sound quality
Sound quality is below average tbh , on 50% volume its good , but when u go around 20% 25% then the headphones starts to skip few beats which are of lower amplitude , i dont know if its my unit of what but it does this every time. And wonder why i listen at 20% coz at night 20% feels like 60% of day coz we perceive volume relative to other volumes/loudness.

-----comfort
Well i am bit comfy person soo this for me is not much comfortable , i mean 1hr and its done i have to take break of 5 min or so , it's a good thing if u think about your ears but stillüòÖ",4

8322,230,"This headphone is the best one out there in this price range. After searching alot for wireless headphones, I finally came up to this and I'm not disappointed. The bass is fantastic and the sound quality is good. But the sound on full volume isn't too loud. So if u have a habit of listening music on very loud volumes, then this is not for u. It's not like the sound is too low, it's just not that loud compared to other headphones but I still enjoy listening music in it. The design is very attractive and the red colour looks beautiful. It's comfortable but u may need to remove it for a few seconds and adjust it again cuz the ears start hurting after using it for like 1-1.5 hours. And most importantly, it has a 1 year warranty. But there's only one thing which I hated about this is that the usb cable provided doesn't even fit in it. Didn't they test it before putting it in? I had to use my phone cable to charge it. Other than that, it's good

My final verdict- 9/10",4

 Box got wet due to rain...... But thank god product did not got wet..... Product working good.... But be alert of the packing",4

8325,233,Mike do not work properly during call or anything,3
8326,234,"Edit: After 1 year of usage.
The headphone starts developing cracks in the overhead plastic band, the padding on the earcups and head band started coming off. The boat logo has completely vanished (all this happened even after taking utmost care). The sound is still fine.
Please be aware of the cheap plastic and poor built quality of the headphone. Instead of this you can buy Blaupunkt BH01 Eqz headphones which are the best at this price.
PS. The gold plating on the AUX cable will come off creating much disturbance while connecting and listening to music rendering it useless.

EDIT: The sound cut-offs are annoying during watching films or playing. You can't hear some dialogues at low volume.

Honest review after 46 days of usage...
PROS:
‚Ä¢ Good sound quality, vocals are crystal clear. Nice to see AUX cable bundled in the box itself.
‚Ä¢ You can get rich bass in Bluetooth and above average bass using the wired connection.
‚Ä¢ The ear cups are padded with good quality foam and faux leather, no pain on continuous use (Used it for 2-2.5 hours and was still very comfortable).
‚Ä¢ Value for money, Got it for 1099/- only.
‚Ä¢ Not Bass heavy but you can tweak settings to get good bass.
‚Ä¢ Good fit and design.
‚Ä¢ Good Battery backup, got 7 hrs+ on single charge. Full charge takes about 2-3 hours, the orange LED goes off when fully charged.
‚Ä¢ Build quality is good considering the price of the product.
‚Ä¢ Call quality is average (the speaker is not so loud). The headphone also tells the Caller‚Äôs Number during an incoming call.
‚Ä¢ The Latency is also acceptable at this price point.
CONS:
‚Ä¢ On Bluetooth, when the volume is kept very low and the music has a very low pitch, sometimes the left-right speakers turn ON and OFF automatically. (It can be eliminated by keeping volume bar at about 50%, also no problem when connected using Aux cable). I saw this problem in boAt Rockerz 450 as well.
‚Ä¢ When kept at 100% volume the sound tends to get distorted. (Its THD-Total Harmonic Distortion is ‚â§5%, whereas most good headphones have it at ‚â§1%)
‚Ä¢ The aux cable seems to be too thin so be careful while handling it.
‚Ä¢ The earcups are not sweat resistant so take care of it.",2

8329,237,"The quality is good, and most importantly affordable but the adjustment of headphones are tight and secondly the exterior parts are fragile...",4
8330,238,"These headphones are okay and a good deal for the price in my opinion. For me, the sound quality is a little subpar and I feel the high frequencies are really suppressed in these headphones.
So from a music mixing and just pure listening perspective, they AREN'T good at all. But since they are so compact and light, they make ideal headphones for running and working out with, where you are not as concerned with the drawbacks I mentioned. I like them and they work well for the way I use them.
Not the most tech-savvy perspective but hope this helps.",4

1. I got it on 2021 during great Indian festival for 899 don't buy it if its at 1.2k or more than that it ain't worth it.
2. Try out the boat rockerz 450 on sale it was priced the same at 899 normally it is around 1.5k
3. Don't spend more than 1k on headphones if you don't have that much budget or you're a student
4. After buying these products goto the company's official website & register the purchase invoice for warranty claim.

Like-
1. Good sound quality & sound balance not high base or high pitch balanced in all these
2. Noise cancellation good
3. Bluetooth connectivity good (v 5.0)
4. Comes with aux cable in the box
5. Battery backup is good too(1-2 day 100%-30% in normal usage)
Dislike-
1. Cufs are kinda hard type though they contribute in good noise cancellation but ears ache too üòê thumbs down for very long time usage; Solution- make a habit of itüòÇ
2. Right ear cuff comes loose unattached. It's not like its broken or something but it comes in the box like that",3

 So , the most important thing that attracts me buy these headphones is their DESIGNS that's was too much mind-blowing that no headphone have in this price range , I get these Rockerz at 1000 in the sale ... Let's talk about some imp. Points that we all wanna know ..

Pros:-
1.BASS ( 5/5 )
2.Tereble ( 5/5 )
3.Build Quality ( 4/5 )
Note :- It's all depend on how u r using your product whether roughly or nicely.. if u use them wisely then there's no issue with build quality.
4. Looks ( 5/5 ) BLACK & GOLDEN fits better for this one.
5.MIC ( 4/5)
Note:- There's some NOISE CANCELLATION I thought so , it's bit Lower for others to hear while call but that also manage-able Not a HUGE issue
6.Bluetooth Range ( 5/5 )
No problem üëç the range is good compared to the others ..

CONS :-

1.AUX CABLE ( 2/5 )
Note :- It's too thin u have to purchase new one from aftermarket hardly it will cost u around 30 or 40 IF U PURCHASE A GOOD ONE .
2.USB cable ( 2/5 )
Note :- Same issue like with the AUX one , it's also too thin , but it's OK we all can adjust in this price range .... Also I mentioned my own clicked photos there so u can check and assure youself ...
I bought them for my online classes and for listening some songs daily basis üòé

Most of the YOUTUBE channel says ""the bass is not upto the mark "" but I think u should try once by your own and really u will have no issue with it , Both of your üëÇ(ears) start vibrating with the bass.. that feels awesome.. According to my perspective I will give ( 4.5/5 )

Go for this amazing ROCKERZ 370.. if u think that this REVIEW helps u to gain a perfect knowledge about these HEADPHONES then plzz like it.",5

8451,359,"Writing the review after using 1 week
*The ratings I am giving are according to my preference and keep in mind the price also.

Sound quality- 3.5/5 - The sound could have been more bright and the bass was good. Vocal separation was okayish.

Comfort- 3/5- The earcups are not that soft and start to hurt in long use.

Build- 3.5/5 - The build is all plastic with matte finish. Its not that fragile to break easily unless you really try.

Battery-4.5/5- The battery life was quite impressive. My daily use is about 5-6 hours and it easily lasted me around 6-7 days on single charge and you also get aux cable if you run out of battery.

I also have boat rockerz 450 and the sound quality in that is just slightly better but it is way more comfortable than this so if you have to wear headphones for very long time continuously you can go for it but it also costs more and the build quality on that in quite good too.",4

1. Cannot use bluetooth for making calls, attending meeting where I need to speak. The receiver is not able to hear my voice even though I kept the volume to maximum. So I am forced to use a wired connection for the mic to pickup my voice and make it audible to the other side.
2. The build quality - Bought this in April 2021. The headset broke 10 days back, making it unusable. This is the first time a product like headset is broke [see photo] within 6 months of usage. I could have used it for not more than 200 hours at the maximum. Don't know if this is covered in the 1 year warranty that Boat has promised. Now I bought another headset of another brand. Actually disappointed with Boat over these issues.",3
8479,387,"I have been using this earphone for 4 months now, i was not sure about it first but now I am fairly satisfied . Here are some honest pros and cons of this earphone.

PROS:
1. Battery: I can't express how much I am satisfied with it, The packaging says 12 hrs runtime ,but it clearly gives me over 40 hrs. I usually have to charge it 2-3 timesa month. Believe me it sounds unbelievable but it is true.
2. Sound quality : sound quality is fairly clear and bass is also very good, at this price it is as expected.
3. Comfortable: I was not sure about comfort first as my ears were was hurting too much, BUT after 2-3 DAYS IT BEACAME TOTALLY COMFORTABLE. Now if I wear it for whole day long, my ears don't even feel it

CONS:
1. light and generic build quality, it's very light and generic, doesn't give a premium feel ,and always I have to use it cautiously because i feel it would break
2. Mike is very very bad, no one can hear my voice through mike

3. If you stand near wi fi router, it may cause interference in sound.",5

8489,397,"Not comfortable to use as the cushion pads presses the ears tightly so that you will get irritated just after 10 mins of use. Better to go for the ones which has bigger ear pads, so that it covers your full ear. There is no return policy also, so I couldn't return it. Better not to go with this. Sound and build quality is ok.",4
8490,398,It is very good i mean the sound and all it good at this price range. But its build quality is not upto the mark and it may break easily on the edges and most importantly the charging point and aux cable are creating few problems in the device but in some device they perform okay. So it have some problems but at this price range i think it is okay.üôÇ,4
8491,399,"My son says the sound is AWESOME (all-caps = excitement level!), and he's 14 years old so that's a HUGE compliment for this amazing product. As for noise cancellation, he doesn't even hear me when I'm right next to him and speaking directly to him - that's how good it is!

The build quality is excellent and it lasts for quite a bit longer than the stated time for a single charge. He uses it almost constantly and I haven't seen him charging it more than a couple of times a week.

I think this is a very attractive price point because this kind of sound is usually only available on premium brands like JBL and Bose.

Well, yes its faulty that's why I sent for repair. What else does repair request mean? send device with 'all good' status for what???

The company is fooling people by selling China product, and just for selling the product they are stating they provide warranty. In reality, if the product doesn't perform as committed and you send for repair, they will ask you to throw it - immaterial of warranty or not!!!

18-Sept-2022: I just received the returned faulty product that they refused to repair. And now they have pulled the wire in such a way that the wire continuity seems to be broken. I DID NOT give the product to them in this condition - THEY BROKE IT so that they don't have to provide me a replacement!!!
The agency of BOAT in India appear to be fraudulent specially for after sales service!!!!!! I have added 2 more pictures to show the wire they broke

I am thinking of bringing this in consumer court!",1
8503,411,"Hi I am going to give clear review about this headset.
First of all sound quality is very supper.
Bass is also good it comes according to song requirment.
Noice cancellation is ok.
Battery backup is very powerful.
It's sound processing is awesome.
I had noticed sound from left speaker comes loud and basse and whereas right has more of vocal therefore sound generated feels like surrounding sound.
But it's irritating something but due to this effect sound comes properly.
But biggest backpoint is confort you can't were it continues for 1 hrs
After some time ears start paining.
Overall is perfect product and value for money. Please tell that sound in left speaker is more that right speaker or its my headphones problem.",4
8504,412,Fully satisfied üëåüôèüëçüëè,5
8505,413,Build quality is cheap. Very delicate. The earlier version had better build quality. Sound is also average. Sounds outdated and lacks clarity. Lacks punch. Over all this one feels outdated. They shud discontinue this model.,2

8513,421,"Starting with the what all things come inside the boAt Rockerz 370 Wireless Headset is , On Ear Headphone, Micro USB cable(to charge your headset), 3.5mm Audio Cable (to connect your headset with your phone), Manual, Warranty Card(one year warranty card).

Starting with the review for the product.
Personally i really liked the product, it's sound quality is just awesome and loud such that increasing it volume to max you won't be able to hear outside voice even though noise cancellation is not mentioned in product description, and bass for this headset is really better than other products of same price range.

Talking about bluetooth connectivity it's really instant, within fraction of seconds it gets connected to your device , only when you use product for the first time then only it will take a little time ie.4-5 second to connect
And Battery backup is so good that I haven't charged the headset since the day it has arrived ie 3 days after extensive use.

boAt Rockers 370 is surely better than products in same price range in every aspects but I didn't liked the short length of the extension to headset provides by company it's short for me and the cushion cup is soft but ear start paining after using it for 1-2 hours.",4
8514,422,Good sound quality product but 1 and only dropback is bluetooth is getting disconnected frequently,4
8515,423,Fit and finish could have been better. When extended a wire also come out of place. Sound quality is good.,4

8519,427,"I like that,.",4
8520,428,There is problem with the mic. It is not good to do calls over it. As the person on other side will not be able to hear you properly even if you speak louder.,2
8521,429,A pretty decent pair of headphones. Sound quality is great. Feels like surround sound. Bit tight on the head. But with time I guess it will be comfortable.,5

8523,431,"Such a poor quality product and brand too I've ever seen, only poslished and attractive by outside, while inner material is so bad in nature.

8529,437,Good,4
8530,438,Best quality in this budget!üëç,5
8531,439,Its very fragile.. Wire comes out when you try to extend the headphones. Bass is not upto the mark.. Its either too much or very less.. The ear cups dont fit your ear properly.. Its should have been designed in such a way that it fits every ear.. Coushion of ear cups are a bit hard.. Volume is very good..connectivity is also good.. But for such less money its fits in perfectly.. You cant expect more .. All in all its value for money per the price.,4
8532,440,Packing was very satisfying. Product is also nice.,4
8533,441,The headphones are good in terms of sound quality but it is not good in terms of build quality very weak plastic it broken while I trying to wear on my head.,3

8541,449, Nice and decent could be better. Good amount of bass and sometimes you will feel trebles and voice a bit low. But IF YOU ARE USING WITH AUX(WIRED) THEN BUTTONS WILL NOT WORK HAVE TO CONTROL EVERYTHING EITH PHONE/PC THAT'S ACTUALLY WORST. Otherwise when using with BLUETOOTH ALL BUTTONS ARE FUNCTIONAL. Can be recommended easily,4
8542,450,"Really a worst product. Wasted my 1000 in it, at starting it was working good. But after a month it started making a creepy noise during beats or bass of music.",2
8543,451,"Sound is good but, when you play over 90% sound volume, with a punchy music then it's sound quality is too bad.",4
8544,452,"They are really nice
Nice audio quality nice build everything is worth it and for this price wow its super good

Only bad thing is the size of the earcuffs they are small like small for most ears, they perfectly just covers my ears but thats because my ears are small too for anyone else in my family they are kinda small and hurts there ears

I have issue that the earcups are soft but not for long term use bcoz headphone apply pressure and cups also not manage it . You cannot use for long-term use . The build is plastic and the extenders are also plastic but not that weak that they cannot handle pressure , if you do that with patiently . Although a good buy if you want it !!!!",5

8683,591,"Sound quality good as usual, noise cancellation is decent and clear voice while calling, bass is better in this range, also for recording purpose I would say use AUX cable rather than Bluetooth. Plastic quality is something to take care of, as it's hard plastic , so more chances to break. Overall I would say it's good product to buy for daily call, music need. No ear pain till 45 min.",4

8752,660,"For a boAt product its quiet cheap. But the thing is that after buying it, within 3 months I'm facing issues with it. The main issue is that when I lower the mobile volume below 50% suddenly both sides of the headphones stops working. So I had to always put the phone volume above 50%",3

I saw some reviews in which people moaning about no noise cancelation, poor bass poor quality etc.. please don't bullshit. This is a good product. Look the price!

8834,742,"Pros
1) Good Sound Quality with decent Bass
2) Decent noice cancellation due to Tight earcussions.
3) Great Aesthetics and Light Weight

Cons
1) Sometimes there is no sound in one of the earcups
2) They are not comfortable even for short period use. I ordered it specifically for online meetings but they are uncomfortable and causes pain over ears in just 30 minutes. So forget long usage. Company claims these are""Ergonomically designed"". No they are not. It is designed such that if you increase headband size, they become more tight. There's no point of good sound quality if you can't wear them.
Conclusion: Don't buy these if you looking for comfortable headphones. Buy these headphones only for their design. You can get same sound quality in other headphones for same price.",3

8844,752,Very worst build quality did not use even that much broken in a month of usage ü§¨,1
8845,753,"Well I am writing this review after 6 months of daily usage. If you are looking for a headphone in mid range budget with awesome sound quality with a perfect bass then go for this.

After my 6 months usage, I am totally satisfied with this product. The battery backup wonders me. After a full charge, if you use it 5-6 hours per day then it will last for about 4-5 days.
The sound quality is also of high definition. Bass is also wonderful. Connectivity range is also good not very good. Just one thing with what I would like to say it Ok is its microphone . Microphone works well in noise cancelling but range of mic is some less.
Overall you can purchase this product without any worries. I hope that you also will like it.
I am regretting one thing also that is I had ordered black colour which I am not liking much as compared to other two colours",5

8851,759, Do not purchase this. After few days of usage it broken automatically. Worst material,4
8852,760,Well the sound quality is good but not very good still volume is low sometimes it got disconnected buy itself pause music and many more,3
8853,761,"Honestly it is worth the money they ask for.
I've been using this for the last 2/2.5 months and can say that this is better than any headphones I used before.
Pros:-
1. Absolutely amazing sound quality . And because of the noise cancellation , even 70% volume is more than enough for listening .
2. As a edm listener, I have got to applaud the bass quality which is amazingly awesome in this headphone
Cons:-
1. The one and only con I've experienced is the earpain after using it for long time.eg- watching a movie or binging a show.

Overall it's worth it and you should try it if you're looking for good headphones below 1500 or so.",5

Why not replace it? Not possible they don't replace if it has hardware problem like breaking or loosing etc
Even if they did i have to travel just to get this lousy stupid thing replaced, wait and waste my time i can't

Sound quality is good.",3
9462,1370,Seriously very good audio and noise cancelation just awesome!,5
9463,1371,"Bought this for 999/-
Its only good thing is battery life. Charging time around 1 hour and gives 3 days of battery life.
Bass is fine, you have to tweak the settings in equalizer from phone apps but other than that its fine. ( rockerz 400 had way more bass but very less battery life 8hrs)
Sound quality is good for its price, cant complain.
the teal blue colour is my fav, it just looks very attractive and also fits well. ( you will get slight discomfort and pain after long usage for around 4 hrs and more, but in time you'll get used to it.)
so yes I only love it for the looks and battery life :)

9700,108," I'm a person who loves sound quality more than looks. And to be honest, JBL's wired earphones are better compared to this. Lookwise it's good i like it better than boult maverick but sound quality wise speaking it's not so good. Infact both this one and boult maverick they are same, they both have too much base. You won't be able to listen to the actual voice properly. It was delivered within 2 days so Amazon did a good job in delivering the product.

9703,111,Getting ear pains after connecting 15 min,4
9704,112,"I was looking for a generic pair of buds that are ok on music, good mic sensitivity for phone and video calls, and does not burn a hole in your pocket. This product checks on all the above.

Pros:

1. I bought the white ones, and they look great. The case feels great in hand. Everything has a satin finish that gives a premium feel.
2. The top slides out instead of lifting like a flap, that makes it look unique.
3. Quad mic gives good sensitivity for calls.
4. No touch feature on the pods, so no accidental start/stop of calls or audio.
5. No problems with connectivity so far.

Cons (for some people):

1. Definitely not, I repeat not, for bassheads. The sounds quality is balanced between bass, mids and highs. So if you like the deep rumble, you will be disappointed. Sounds quality is excellent otherwise.
2. No noise cancellation. You will get to hear some ambient noise always.
3. Comes with only set of buds in the box. So based on the size of your earholes, this may not be a good fit. Mine always feel a bit loose. Wanted to get some buds separately, but getting green buds is not easy. And the green color on the buds in the box is very unique, any replacement will only be a compromise on the looks.",5

Okay for the price I paid. I was using dell ultrasharp before so I cant compare between these two. It could be a good choice if you are going with your first ever 27inch full HD.
Okay for normal browsing, movies and basic multimedia tasks( Adobe PS,LR,AI,PP ), Backlight bleed is so annoying.
Color accuracy is somewhere near 75-80% which seems to be okay for me at this price level. But if the price is near @15k better to go with Gigabyte 27F.",4
10594,2," Monitor is stylish on aesthetic terms. Performance normal as I use this solely for net browsing. Sound is feeble and volume should be adjusted to high in settings menu> audio>volume. Used only hdmi port. No flicker, no bleeding noticed. For normal regular home use it is enough. Presentable in living room also. Benq is a reputed brand. But wait... the price is high. Should you pay this much for a home use casual netbrowse this and that use monitor. Upto you. If brand and class is your liking and money is less concern it is for you. Prefer 27 inch if your budget permits. Don't expect a big audio output from monitor. It is just for system sounds play only. You can attach additional speakers to monitor, and headphones also. But the weird thing is why don't you attach these to cpu itself!!! No volume control knobe, no remote. Just a good looking monitor. Height adjustment my favourite and I went for it only because of that. If you decide to buy it that is not a bad a decision. Works with linux and windows plug and play. No issues. Video shows linux desktop. Resolution 1920x1080 is good for multimedia use only. For normal work and text reduce it. I changed it to 1366x768 and is good for reading a lot of text online.",4

Audio volume is low, this can be improved.
Screen flickering is happening when we switch off/on any appliances when used on the same phase. This is little confusing why it is happening with this monitor.
Not sure how it is protecting our eyes. May be it is helpful for strong eyes but not sure for coding activity continously during WFH.
It is still working ok.
May be we can go for TV instead of using this monitor.",4
10599,7,It looks great! And worth for money. And durable too!,4
10600,8,"I like the auto adjustment of brightness, which is good for eye protection",4
10601,9,"I purchased this monitor for the sole purpose of using it as a vertical monitor. My job requires me to read a lot on my PC, and ever since I started using one a few weeks ago, vertical monitors have become indispensable in my Work From Home setup. This is my second such monitor, the first one been a Dell P2419H, commendably serving my requirements in the office. At home, however, I felt the need for a slightly larger screen; one that can be kept at a distance, so that my study table isn't cluttered. The Dell P2719H was my first consideration. Its asking price, however, far exceeded the budget I had allocated for the purpose. My second option was the HP E273 - again, priced as much as the Dell, so was dropped. The third option was a model by AOC (a brand I didn't know a lot about). It seemed to tick all the boxes, and in fact I even ordered it. And that's when I came across this new Prime Day launch by BenQ. It was going at ‚Çπ17,500, a good ‚Çπ3500 less than the Dell's asking price. So it didn't take me long to convince myself to cancel my AOC order, and opt for this BenQ monitor instead.

On its own, this is a good monitor, and one that does its job well. Its when you have the luxury to compare it with another IPS panel, that you notice the shortcomings. Like I said, the IPS panel on the BenQ GW2780T is good, but Dell's panel is better. The build quality is good, but Dell's is superior. The BenQ's speakers are rubbish, and my laptop's internal speakers are way better. No, seriously. The speakers on the BenQ are terrible, and aren't even loud enough to justify their inclusion. The Dell, on the other hand, did not even bother to mount any speakers, for better or worse; instead, Dell comes with a built-in USB hub, which is a far more useful feature to have. It has 2 USB 3.0 ports, and 2 USB 2.0 ports. The slower USB 2.0 ports are useful to plug in your wireless keyboard/mouse dongle, and the the USB 3.0 ports are always useful to have if you wish to leave your portable HDD plugged in (haven't tested their transfer speeds). Hands down I'd opt for Dell's USB hub feature over BenQ's terrible internal speakers. Both Dell and BenQ offer matte finish panels, which are inherently less reflective, unlike the HP E273, I think.

Like I said, the Dell's display panel is, in my opinion, superior to the BenQ's. Lesser backlight bleeding and better colour reproduction are two things that I immediately noticed. Also, the viewing angles are better on the Dell, although both BenQ and Dell house IPS panels. Then again, BenQ's panel is more than sufficient for my requirement, which is to read documents and articles in the vertical position. Both the panels appear to have a similar set of additional features, with one model offering something that the other doesn't, and vice versa.

To sum up: but for the significant price difference, I would have opted for the 27"" version of Dell's offering. But that doesn't mean that BenQ's GW2780T is a bad monitor by any means. In fact, on its own, I think its a very capable monitor, and its capabilities match my requirements sufficiently. But if and when you do find the price difference to be negligible, I would suggest you opt for the Dell's offering. You will not go wrong in opting for this BenQ monitor. Its just that Dell is better, and it costs a lot more.",4
10602,10,"Delivered very fast, monitor is really good at this price, do not buy because of inbuilt speaker it works but nor for the lovers.

Experience with the delivery: Well, Received a damaged monitor right out of the box, I had to call 3-4 times amazon to deal with the situation and finally they arranged the replacement after tons of arguments.

Monitor quality: Brightness and colors are really good, decent size for the 27"" monitor. Not the best for creators, but works if you're not doing some serious color correction work.

Be that as it may, you may be annoyed by the screen's pixelation. This is a 1920*1080 p screen. Meaning if you are using this to extend or duplicate a 14-inch laptop's complete HD-display, you will surely be annoyed by the pixelation.

10647,55,Good monitor but it could be supplied with 5A plug instead of 15A. Plug sockets of 15A are lesser in house and thus restricts placement of monitor in room.,4
10648,56,"Monitor is good. I used it for my Xbox Series S as well as my work laptop. No complaints so far on the 2nd day of purchase. Speaker sound is just enough for me, since I sit close. However two issues.

Issue #1

First the monitor comes with a large 16 ampere plug which is usually used in microwaves and fridges so a socket which can accept that is required. I had to buy a 6A to 16A multi-plug converter since I did not have a spare 16A socket. I bought it offline for Rs 250. So better buy the converter before hand and keep ready. Unnecessarily they have shipped with large plug.

Issue #2

Product description on Amazon for the BenQ GW2480 24-inch says it has 2xHDMI ports but in fact it has 1xHDMI, 1xVGA and 1xDisplay Port. Misleading description on the product page. This should be corrected.",4

Cons:

2. it only has a single HDMI although it has a display port and VGA, it should have at least 2 HDMI.",4

10655,63,Worth to Buy ....Good one .....Relief from eye strain,5
10656,64,"Hi,
I am using this monitor with my laptop - using a HDMI cable.
With my laptop I use a external mouse as well - a Logitech Bluetooth/ wireless.

Display is all fine. Could play Prime-Video and sound was coming from monitor speakers (as expected)

Observed that my mouse becomes un-responsive after a few minutes of working, but laptop touchpad continues to work.

After I disconnect the HDMI and I return back to the laptop built-in-display the external mouse starts working as expected.

So I connected monitor and laptop with a VGA. (D-Sub) - the issue did not recur.

Issue seems to be with only HDMI.
But of course I loose the advantage of a HDMI.

Could somebody offer any clues on this peculiar behavior.

PS: I have done all the other diagnosis, replaced battery in mouse. Tried the mouse with another laptop. No issues with the mouse were observed and arrived on the above conclusion.",3
10657,65,"Absolutely amazing monitor. Definitely recommended for the price. Best value for your money in the segment without a doubt. After days of research and enquiries for a 22"" monitor, and comparing it with Dell's & HP's, I ended up buying a pair of GW2283's for my video editing setup. What a delight to the eyes! Go for it without a doubt, I'm not regretting a single penny spent. Definitely at par with Dell's & HP's IPS 22"" monitors, saving you around 1k for the same performance and build quality. Maybe if you search this in your local market, you can buy it for a bit cheaper. But I had no option as such so went on via amazon.

Pros-
1. Although I have a dual-display setup, a single 22"" will be productive enough for most of the tasks, especially this having a 1080p res.
2. This thing is built like a tank! So robust and heavy, i wasn't expecting it to be of this premium built-quality for the price I paid. This thing is HEAVY! Durability- 11/10.
3. Really good panel. BENQ has been an understated brand but believe me, the actual display quality is no less than it's competition, even at comparatively lower prices. Brightness- 8/10 | Sharpness- 9/10 | Color Accuracy (in the segment)- 9/10 | Anti-glare Display- Good readability in direct light (though it reduces the overall brightness but the negotiation is worthy) | Great Viewing Angles and Adjustability- IPS panel, nothing more to say.
4. I/O management deck- definitely helpful to keep things organised when you got crazy wiring all around as in my setup. Practical design.
5. Also the overall packaging was really good. It came all foamed up in a double cardboard box. Good job Amazon. BENQ package was however far superior with all kinds of protection.

Cons-
1. No HDMi cable provided in the package, although the monitor itself has 2√ó HDMi ports. Just 1 VGA cable (of good quality) provided.
2. Only tilt adjustment for the stand, no height and swivel adjustment, but that's just nit picking. Won't expect that from the segment.
3. This thing is heavy. But definitely it has its benefits in terms of durability.
4. The built-in speakers are just, meh! Not too loud, not too crisp and clear. Just average. Does the job. Sounds more like a mono rather than stereo, but I personally use headphones for my job so no big deal for me.
5. It is not completely bezel-less design. There is a thin in-display bezel after the rim of the panel. Actually the overall bezel is more like 3mm from all sides when actually booted up. Its not absolutely bezeless as they show in the picture, but the crop is minimum.

Verdict- Overall a great, robust, practical and powerful tool for your setup if you want durability, great display quality, performance and practicality. Nothing fancy, but still looks appealing, sleek and smooth to the eyes. Highly recommended to pick one of these uo, you wont regret for what you spend.
1080p Res, 60Hz refresh rate, IPS panel features, robust design and build quality, premium looks, super practical. What else do you expect for 7.5k bucks?

JUST GO FOR IT.",5
10658,66,It‚Äôs good go for it in budget monitor except sound quality,4
10659,67,"Excellent viewing angles, crisp picture quality, the stand is very sturdy and easy to control",4
10660,68," Purchased this monitor, a few days ago, with the height adjustment capability as I have a small-medium work table on which I can raise the height of the monitor and place my MacBook/laptop in the gap between stand and screen (Pic attached). Go for height adjustment option if you have less space on table to manage laptop/keyboard and mouse or you need a tilt/rotating monitor display.

After 3 days of using this monitor for my everyday office work and watching the OTT (Netflix, Prime, Youtube mostly) content, here is what I think are the pros & cons of this monitor.

Display:
1. This is a full HD 1080p display the HD content looks manageable. Videos content from OTTs can be easily enjoyable.
2. Text doesn't look pixelated and for the programming/coding the portrait mode is just awesome.
3. Gets enough bright during the day even while facing direct sunlight. During the night, brightness intelligence kicks in and reduces the blue light emissions.But it's hardly noticeable.
4. The viewing angles aren't that impressive while watching video contents, but one can be comfortable working on the text, docs and excels.

Sound:
1. Well, with 16 watts built-in speakers, one cannot expect a premium sound quality however I can easily manage my office Skype calls without headphones and the sound is clear.
2. When listening to OTTs or video/audio content the sound is decent enough but it's just monotonous. (let alone the HQ & Dolby). Sample video clip attached.
3. I have connected my JBL flip 3 bluetooth speaker with 3.5mm audio input to this monitor and it solves the purpose of watching/streaming video content to a great extent.

Ports:
1. Has a HDMI port, a display port and a VGI port. (Sadly, no USB ports). A 3.5mm audio input port through which one can connect external speakers. (My JBL Flip 2 works like a charm).
2. Comes only with a HDMI to HDMI cable (1.5ft) and a power cord in the box.

Flexibility:
1. The height adjustment option makes this monitor an excellent choice near 10K and makes the competitors run for their money with screen rotation, 30-40% tilt.
2. As the display can be raised up-to ~ a feet, it creates a good gap between the stand and screen beneath which I easily keep my PC and my phone on a Techzere laptop stand. (Saves a great amount of space for my keyboard and mouse).
3. The monitor(with height adjustment) is arguably heavy with about 6kgs of weight and my work table is wall mounted hence I am not sure I can let this monitor, along with other accessories be as is. So consider the weight, should you often tend to displace the monitor from time to time.

At 11k, I find this a good addition to my WFH set-up, not good for video editing or 4K content. Only sad point is that this is MADE IN CHINA.",4
10661,69,"Long term review after 1 year 8 months! Absolutely fantastic!!
Usage : Photo & Video editing, general media consumption.
Tenure : 20 months
The Benq 27in renewed monitor is a beast, no color calibration needed and works straight out of the box with mac & windows, absolutely flawless! Brightness is really good, color reproduction and contrast are amazing. No complaints at all, hence going for another one for a dual screen setup.

As a photographer this is a dream setup if you are looking for a budget monitor which fits all your requirements, its not a 2k or a 4k display but 1080p is really amazing and serves the purpose. The 27in screen is ideal for horizontal timeline edits.
PS: I have two 27 inch monitors, writing this review based on that! :)",5
10662,70,"Bought this monitor on 5th Jan 2018 at Rs. 15,499 in lightning deal

Following are my observations:
1) The first thing I noticed is that top and side bezels of the monitor are very thin which is aesthetically pleasing and gives it a premium look.
2) Screen is decent and has good brightness and contrast. Not sure about color reproduction but it feels alright.
3) Screen has a refresh rate of 60 Hz at 1920x1080 resolution. However it has an option of 75 Hz at 1024x768 resolution also.
4) Even though this monitor has Eye Care (Bright Intelligence), I felt that the sensor adjusted brightness is on higher side for my liking.
5) There is slight backlight bleed at top left corner of monitor which is noticeable only in very dark environments but overall has uniform IPS Glow.
6) Response time mentioned on the box is 5ms (Gray to Gray) and I felt it to be good for FPS games. Overall, it's a good monitor for casual gaming.
7) It comes with UK style power cord and needs a converter/adapter or a spike guard will work.
8) The box also includes HDMI cable and the monitor has cable management as shown in product description which I felt is a nice addition to the package.

Monitor has following ports:
D-Sub
HDMI Port
Display Port
Line-in port and
3.5 mm jack for plugging in earphones

This monitor also has in-built speakers which are pointed downwards. The quality of audio from them is nothing to brag about and max volume is that of a typical tablet (my iPad Pro 12.9"" 2017 has better sound output than them) but no complaints here considering the price of the monitor.

Overall this monitor is value for money product considering the price I got it for.

But if you want to play a high graphic oriented game like cyber punk its better to get a monitor with refresh rate as 120HZ as this monitor will sure cause screen tearing. Overall a good product

One major con is the power cable pins are not suited for indian sockets. The pins are larger and since its a china product it comes with a default plug size customized for China. Please provide an adapter for indian sockets as this monitor is a 13K product.",4
10680,88,You don't get standard india plug it's a BIG one,4
10681,89,"I bought this in late December 2019 for 12.9K. I had switched to this from a 22 inch LG monitor (model 22MP68VQ, to be precise). The color reproduction on that monitor was downright brilliant. So, when I plugged this one in out of the box, to be honest, I was somewhat disappointed. The colours looked so faded and unappealing, the blacks were nowhere near black and the overall panel appeared to be so low quality, that I almost contemplated returning it.

However, when I tinkered with its settings, boy was I amazed. The color reproduction improved massively, including the contrast and brightness. I also made some changes to the Intel display driver's setting (mine is a Windows system), however, that might be different for you based on your system.

First and foremost, go to ""Picture Advanced"" menu on the OSD (on-screen display), and set Picture Mode to ""User"". This will turn off all settings such as Bright Intelligence, Low Blue Light, etc. (Trust me, you don't want to keep them enabled for the best picture quality). Then navigate to ""Picture"" tab in the main menu. Here are the monitor's settings that worked really well for me:

1. Brightness: 100 (you may lower it if it hurts your eyes)
2. Contrast: 60
3. Sharpness: 5
4. Gamma: 5
5. Color Temperature: Normal
6: Hue: 50
7. Saturation: 50

Once you have tweaked settings to the above numbers, you will see it greatly improves the picture quality. However, if you have an Intel display driver like I do, you can tweak the settings there too for an even better picture. Here are the steps for that:

1. Search ""Intel Graphics Command Center"" in start (this may be different for you if you're running an older driver). If you can't find it in start, you should be able to right-click on your desktop and go to Intel Display Settings too.
2. Navigate to the ""Display"" tab.
3. Go to ""Color"" tab in the window.
4. Leave ""Brightness Enhancement"" to default at 50.
5. Change ""Contrast Enhancement"" to 48 from 50.
6. Enable ""Luminance-based Color Model"". (THIS IS A MAJOR GAME CHANGER)

And voila! Your these settings would breathe a new life into an otherwise dull default settings.

One thing to note here is that the piece that I received had slight IPS glow / backlight bleed from upper left corner, mostly noticeable in very dark environments with 100% brightness (see attached picture). However, it is very common in IPS displays, and gets worse as the screen size increases. I didn't want to gamble with a replacement product, so I chose to stick with this one. Mine came with zero dead pixels, so I was worried about the replacement being worse (more backlight bleed / presence of dead pixels).",5
10682,90,"Excellent picture quality and very good for Eyes.

Pros - There are picture modes which you can set to reduce blue light up to 70% - great relief if you are a programmer or spend long time on Computer.
Eye care feature, Picture quality, Monitor stand and look - All great.
Good Brand and it's Made in Taiwan.
Inbuilt Speakers and all types of ports (VGA, HDMI). You can connect external speakers if you looking for Music etc.

Cons - I have to buy 6 ampere power cable (Rs 150 around - you can get in any computer shop). Monitor ships with 16 ampere cable which is not compatible with home sockets. Also Monitor does not need that much current. Benq should ship 6 ampere standard cable in India - something amazon and Benq should be doing already.",4

10687,95,"Overall a good monitor for the ‚Çπ 13.5 K but 16 amp power cable is a let down, one has to buy a 16 amp to 6 amp convertor in case there isn't a compatible socket.",4
10688,96,"VISUAL QUALITY : Sub par quality monitor...
Horrible black levels.. Needs severe tweaking to make it look watchable. OK for office work type of media...NOT for movies. Flickers in certain modes (ECO/STANDARD) the screen keep dimming & brightening up erratically in a mild manner but very noticeable on a white webpage screen like amazon.

SOUND : Volume is not as horrible as people keep claiming. Good enough volume for an office desk. YouTube dialogues are clearly audible. This is the problem when very laypersons try to review (dangerous habit) and comment technically. People here say low volume, low volume, so they were expecting volume like a TV ? Its good enough for an AC room or moderately silent room. Even a little teeny weeny bass percussion sounds are heard. Monitor volume was @75% and system volume @70%. When system volume reaches 100% its actually a bit loud and i had to tone it down. Again this sound is not for entertainment. YouTube technical videos dialogues etc are very clear and resonant.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS : Good ergonomics. Buttons little hard to press due to the position, wrist will ache as you try searching menus. Physical looks wise very smart. The bezel is very thin, but beware the screen doesn't fill right upto the bezel, theres a 5mm black border in the lcd screen itself and the image doesnt fill right into that, so that defeats the purpose of the thin bezel, or maybe ive got a faulty screen so it will go back to amazon. Giving a D-Sub cable for a 1080p monitor with speakers, kudos to Benq on cost cutting, who the hell uses a D-Sub cable nowadays. To top that off, giving us a 16A fridge or washing machine type plug (maybe they got a cheap 3rd party vendor supply lot at lowest cost so they though they would throw that in the box) to save money.",3
10689,97,"Bought it in 2019 for 8k. Still going strong. Casual backlight bleeding not much(expected from IPS)
However, at current price(13k) it is absurd.
It can overclocked to 75hz(Don't make much difference to experience). If you really want to experience higher refresh rate then at least look for 120hz panel.
I am using it at a brightness level of 10 out of 100 as it is too bright to use at higher level.
Colors are very good(Have not used other high end monitors). If it is your first 1080p monitor then you will absolutely love it.
Have 1 HDMI, 1 Display port and 1VGA.
I have found that power cord is a little loose(not so much of big deal).
My personal advice will be to go for a higher refresh rate panel if budget allows.
Enjoy!",4

10691,99,Had backlight bleeding in the beginning but after 25 days almost 80% of bleeding disappeared. And now it's barely noticeable at 100%.,4
10692,100,"Benq being Benq, bought it for professional purpose with a little bit of gaming. Monitor is beautiful, monitor stand is outstanding. True colours and not the usual marketing gimmicks of over contrasty or vibrant images likes most samsung and other brands, the standard colour setting keep colours real, while other settings can change vibrance, sharpness, contrast, RGB range, colour format, Grey to Grey, low blue light, pixel clock, phase, hue, saturation, gamma etc. My experience has been great till now, using Photoshop, Da Vinci Resolve, Luminar AI etc.
Colours from Raw files or video logs show accurate colours as shot. Gaming is bright, crisp, not as good as 144hz 1ms but then again this is a 80% professional use monitor. It has a 3 side bezelless design, only slightly thicker than a needle. Has a light sensor at bottom center for auto brightness as per ambience and hardware OSD buttons, with one of them being the power button that lights up while monitor is on. Screen is matte non reflecting, not even the slightest reflection from any light source at around 5 feet away. For professionals, this monitor can be rotated to portrait but you must set it to portrait mode on windows 10 first, before rotating.

Cons - the packaging by benq could have been a little better, when taking out the entire thermocol pack, the base of the monitor stand instantly fell off, hence the stand was not reinforced by a tape or something to keep it in place

The monitor comes with a big 16A plug which is very funny as the monitor not only uses a max 27W but the box in which it's packed, states that it uses a max of around 1.65A, the big plug is very hard to use as it's not always possible to have that big of a socket available, specially when everything has already been planned wiring wise. Benq chat support later suggested that I can use a 10A, but even a 5A will do. Overall as a professional who plays minimal games once in a while. This is a good purchase.",5

I'm using 8-10 hours per day, my eyes are burning sometimes.

Overall it's good at this price range.",5
10695,103,"After nearly a week of its usage, I face no issues in the functioning of monitor in terms of display pixels and backlight bleeds as such. Its calm on the eyes, but you need to struggle a bit on setting up the colors especially if you are using it as a second monitor as you would be accustomed to your main monitor.

For this price it is definitely worth it. Go for it when the price is around 13-13.6K.

Couple of issues that I ran into when I got the monitor

1. You get a 16A AEH power cable. I dont know what is the guy at BenQ thinking when keeping this cable. The major consumer base who would buy a monitor will not have a source that supports this power cable in their room......common sense at least in this case. I had to buy another cable of 6A and yes the monitor supports it. Though security during voltage fluctuations is a concern, think about flexibility as well. Not a good move.

2. Multiple buttons for monitor controls. You could make this with a single joystick like button to navigate through the controls instead of having multiple buttons that are confusing especially if you want a quick switch in the set up, you have to struggle.

These issues aside it does a pretty neat job serving as a good 1080p 60Hz monitor beside my 144Hz 1440p monitor.",4
10696,104,"Writing this review after 1 year use.

Picture quality is really good with auto brightness at daylight and night.. I used it for trading and watching

10697,105,"I have worked on many monitors (Dell, HP, Acer) in office and home. Never had a Benq. I will get this out of the way, my favourite brand is Dell (I have bought around 10 products). I was torn between the Dell (2717H), Viewsonic and Acer. For some reason I never had a good experience with products of HP.

My requirement was a 27"" monitor. I am not a serious gamer only play casual games from time to time. The main purpose was to do programming and watching videos (and reading). This monitor suits perfectly.
Pros:
- Excellent display. It had a bit of light bleed on top right corner but it was just the glass a bit out. I just pressed it in and the bleed was gone.
- Good contrast and viewing angles. I have not played any FPS games till now but overall the experience till now (10 days) has been smooth and consistent. The 5ms response time is good enough for me.
- Although it is a 1080p display, the text and videos appear sharp, no pixelation or ghosting. Colours are uniform and even.
- Bluelight filtering is good. Helps when reading a long book / article and puts less strain in the eyes.
Cons:
- The Eyecare feature is a bit aggressive. The display becomes too bright for the surrounding light. I just switched it to standard and set the brightness and contrast to levels I am comfortable with. The day/night light in my room doesn't differ much so I don't need to change the settings.

Other monitors with similar features were around or over 20k, I got this for 17k. Overall a very good budget monitor. It also has 3 years warranty which is good and tells that I can expect a pretty long life from this.

Let me know if you need to know more.",5

10705,113,"I was skeptical about this BenQ G480 eye care 24‚Äù inch monitor first. After a lot of research, I found this monitor too good for regular reading and office work. I previously had a DELL 21.5 inch monitor which that has a really thin bezel on the side and the top. Further, it is quite good in color production along with two fine speakers at the bottom.

Now, for the last 1 year, I had this severe pain in my eyes as I mostly work in front of the screen. The pain gradually increased at times I couldn‚Äôt even stare at the screen perhaps, due to the harmful blue light emission. I was waiting for the shopping days to come up where I can buy a decent monitor(bigger size) and also that could help me get rid of severe eye strain.

As I already use blue cut lenses I did not find the previous monitor abstain harmful blue light. And this time I have decided to buy the BenQ monitor 24 inches (Eye Care). I did not expect to be excellent in color production either I play games using this.
After, I received the monitor which I purchased just for 7.8k during the festive season deal.

I found the feature ‚ÄúLow blue light‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrightness intelligence technology‚Äù - uses a dedicated sensor to map out the ambient lighting to adjust the temperature and brightness of the screen which seriously I have never seen on budget monitors.
Anyways, I am quite happy with the purchase I have tested and experienced no flicker issue neither extreme blue light emission after you have just switched to ‚ÄúLow blue light emission‚Äù.

In addition, I received a major upgrade to 24 inches that allow me for seamless reading. Moreover, the monitor comes with 36 months of on-site warranty but sadly, you can register the monitor on their website there is no option to do that.
I have seen people complaining about the screen bleeding issue. Fortunately, I did not face anything yet.

I am in love with my new 24 inches BenQ monitor irrespective of having 5 ms response and limited to 60Hz refresh rate. This monitor is perfect for and reading, working for a longer duration but can‚Äôt say about photo or video editing work. I purchased the monitor mainly seeing the eye care technology that puts less strain on eyes even after continuous usage of 6 hours.

I have attached several photos of the monitor and how it looks exactly. Also, I have tried to show the features that you can access using the buttons beneath the screen.",5

Second order -(3rd monitor) -- screen started flickering after a few days, I thought I'd just return this and go for the 24inch one, but amazon said only replacement was possible. The replacement (4th monitor) has been running fine so far (3 weeks now).

I wonder if the first 3 were products returned by other customers..

Monitor review
Pros- Price, Vesa mount
ports (2x hdmi, 1x VGA), audio out/in ports
Speakers- Nothing special, but for me its fine for watching random youtube videos, pretty useful when you can't be bothered to put on the headphones. helps in cutting down headphone usage a bit i guess
Auto brightness - not as sensitive as phone screen, but works...
Low blue light mode- Good but, might be easier to use night mode button in windows 10 than to reach out to press the button on monitor
customisable buttons x3, ( i've assigned low blue light mode, brightness and input source to them)

Cons-
Only vga cable provided (would have been better if it was hdmi)
Power cable is a bit short, not a problem if you're not using a mount. Since I'm using those gas spring mounts, I have to put my UPS on the desk to move the monitor freely without stressing the power cable.",4

10727,135,"ill split my review into two parts gaming and casual use

gaming
this is definitely a capable monitor for gaming. gorgeous colors, deep contrasts and overall just looks amazing. AAA titles are just an amazing experience especially if your main display is your laptop screen. just two different worlds.
that said this monitor is noticeably held back by its refresh rate. my laptop screen clicks by at 120hz, nearly twice that of this and although it does not make a huge difference in single player games it really is quite noticeable in games like pubg and cs go. definitely would not recommend if your primary purpose is gaming (especially competitive gaming)

casual use
Much of my collage work has shifted over to online work since the pandemic so i find myself spending a ridiculous amount of time in front of a screen. the bigger screen definitely helps productivity i find. usually have a split screen setup going with this. the viewing angles are also pretty awesome. no color distortion as far as i can tell. definitely not compared to the laptop monitor i use.
now the on to the main reason i got this monitor,
i thought about it and i found that i was spending about 2-4 hours a day on a computer per day and that rises significantly on a weekend. on average about 25-30 hrs a week most of this is web browsing watching videos (youtube, movies, etc) and small part would be gaming.

In short if you want the best gaming monitor i suggest looking elsewhere. if you want one of everything else this is a great buy for the price.
ps ive been told its pretty good for Photoshop too( i dont use it myself so i cant verify.)",3

10729,137,"Picture clarity is great. Screen quality is awesome. The blue light filter modes really help in working for extended periods without eye fatigue. The contrast and color saturation is good and it makes for a pleasant movie watching experience. However, please don't buy this monitor for the in-built speakers.

After lots of research on internet I decided to buy this Benq monitor. But, after using it for more than 1 month, here are my opinion about this monitor.

PROS :-

- Looks and Build quality is awesome.
- Cable management at its best. If your monitor is going to be visible from backside also, then you should definitely buy this monitor.
- 2 HDMI Ports is a advantage.
- Brightness auto adjustment sensor is also very good addition and its works perfectly. After using this you will get used to it and it is very difficult to go back again.
- Stand is very sturdy and simple yet stylish.
- Overall Image quality is good considering this is the cheapest IPS LED Full HD monitor.

CONS :-

- If you are a tech person then you are NOT going to like its Display quality. It is good but NOT excellent. Overall I am NOT happy as I am a tech person. For normal people this is a very good display.
- Only VGA cable is provided in the box and NO HDMI cable. This is really SAD. Quality of image from VGA cable connection is Average. Strangely it is showing some flickering on screen which is NOT good. I don't know it is only for my unit or everyone is facing it.
- Factory Color calibration is NOT at all good. You have to adjust many settings according to your requirement.
- After connecting with HDMI cable I observed that it is showing too much whiter shade in black areas which is NOT good. It was not the case with VGA connection for same settings.
- If you use it on User Defined Picture mode then it shows nice colors and deep blacks.

Conclusion:-

If your budget is strictly low and you want good monitor, then only buy this one. Or I strongly suggest you go with LG monitors.",3

If you are looking for 27inch 1080p Full HD with Affordable Price Range. This is the Best in the class available go for it as other competition are in high price range Benq is one of the best in monitors. Suitable for WFH Office and watching Movies.
Pros
-> Got the product Delivered on Time with proper Packing from Amazon .
-> No Dead pixel seen on the product and working perfectly fine.
-> Installation and Usage are easy. It comes with Power cord and one HDMI to HDMI cable.
-> IT has inbuilt Speakers . Works Well if u are attending Meetings or Watching Movies when u connect your monitor to the Laptop. Helpful for long hour meeting so u can avoid connect head phone or laptop speakers.
-> BenQ Brightness Intelligence. Good and Nice feature works well and get adjusted based on the surrounding light ambience. Working on Type C display to DVI port to Monitor and HDMI port.
-> Little hesitant for 1080p for 27inch where we may end up seeing pixels. But its other way around for normal Movie watching and Office work you will not see those

Cons
-> Monitor has only HDMI, display Port and VGA port and Audio in.
-> If you are planning to have 2 laptops connected or multiple pc then you may end up to have port availability on the Laptop of PC to have HDMI or display port or VGA.
-> VGA has the limitation of only Video output.
-> Display ports are not available in recent laptops they have either Type C or HDMI only . So you may end up spending addition 1500rs for type C to Display Cable if you are planning to add mutiple monitor with 1080 p and Audio \video.
->Note: HDMI to DVI cable . PC HDMI port to DVI on monitor doesn‚Äôt work with Passive cables. Make sure you get the correct cable or adapter as the cable is not dual way support. only one direction it works.",5

10741,149," Summary: - rec'd damaged, then replaced. Becomes faulty after 18 months, 47 days taken by customer F1 service centre to replace after weeks of extremely pathetic customer service. WILL NEVER BUY BENQ AGAIN.

18-month Update June 2019: monitor developed fault (review downgraded to 2*)

Monitor became faulty and completely unusable in July 2019. On one hand this is quite unacceptable for the product, it was still not as bad as the experience with the appointed service centre. While I was initially given an early replacement, it was a wrong monitor (27"") and was taken back by the service centre, then they gave me a standby (lower model) and made me wait over 6 weeks for the actual piece, whilst lying, behaving rudely and displaying altogether unprofessional conduct. They sent another wrong monitor (second time), their employees routinely passed the buck, and showed signs of gross incompetence. Please view my public review of F1 Service Centre on Google.

1-Year usage update 28-03-19:

The monitor has served me well so far - definitely great bang for your buck. However, the after-market type power cable supplied with it (as mentioned below) has a terrible connection with the pins at the back of the screen - it comes loose easily and I hear sparking all the time due to the loosened connection. That is definitely an irritant.

Update 30-01-18:

Received the replacement on time and everything is OK so far. The HDMI and power cables included are not original BenQ, obviously a reason why the price is low on the listing. It took a bit of effort to power the screen because the cable isn't 100% fitting the pins, so it had to be pressed in hard.

The screen itself is good, decent colour, contrast and viewing angles. So far so good.

**Old review 26-01-18** (1 star):

This isn‚Äôt so much a product review as it is for the seller!

Firstly turning the screen on took ages, I do not know why. The LED light came on for half a second and went off quickly thereafter, refusing to turn back on. I kept trying, it finally worked after a few minutes. On turning the screen on there was a large black patch at the top of the screen, about an inch in diameter; along with several vertical and horizontal lines across the screen. See pics for reference. Had to order a replacement and I am hoping I will receive a working product this time, as there are no refunds with computer monitors as per Amazon policy, only replacements. So choose wisely as you will be stuck with whatever you order.

As far as everything else goes: Received the product on time, it was packaged well enough. The screen itself is fantastic quality, lovely textured matt on the back, cable management is nice. It is sharp and a good size for desktops (one might choose the 27‚Äù version GW2780 for bigger viewing experience, although sharpness might be affected negatively slightly because the resolution is still only 1080p, and 1440p is the recommend minimum resolution for 27‚Äù screens. I have used a 27"" 1440p and can attest to that.

After 5 mins of use I'd give this screen 4-5 stars easily. Will update once replacement arrives.",2
10742,150,"I have worked for fair amount on some really good monitors and this isn't one of them. Only reason I bought this is because of 5 star ratings. Most people who have rated it 5 stars have probably not used a good display before and they got amazed easily after purchasing this. But believe me DO NOT buy this if you have already used a good monitor like Dell or Apple. You can purchase two for dual monitor setups because both have mostly similar colours. Let me tell you why I'm saying this.
Pros: Cheap, Sturdy construction, thin bezels, non glossy finish unlike Samsung's or LG's ugly shiny displays. Thats it.
Cons: very poor color calibration, in some cases the colours are just worn out and in some cases it gets overexposed,
Speakers...they suck 2/10 score,
The ports, there should have been at least one display port.
Brightness (it is too bright on its default settings, you can keep it that way if you want some more addition to your electricity bill)
Saturation, hue options are useless and only makes it look worse.
The eye care tech is nothing but a gimmick.

I have been using a Dell 21.5 inches monitor for almost 7 years now and even now its a lot better than this Benq one. My Dell monitor has thin borderless bezels, accurate colours, a good display screen and even has the ability to overclock from default 60 hz...I've raised mine to 74hz.
Honestly if Dell was selling this monitor right now, I would have purchased it without a second thought. I had to purchase Benq because I needed something cheaper.
Instead of the useless speakers and stupid eye care tech, they should have made a better panel with accurate colours and brightness.
I am disappointed.
Update: After many-many trail and errors and web research, I am somewhat able to adjust the monitor's display to somewhat accurate colours. Still I won't recommend it to people who have already used a good display.",3

Deducted two stars due to the customer service experience, and not giving us a cost effective repair solution which resulted in more e-waste (we had to request a paid service since the LED panel cracked due a mishap, s**t happens when you have an unsupervised toddler running around the house).

BenQ customer service is a joke. Usually, there won't be any response when you try calling their toll free number (once, I got the message saying that the incoming calls are not allowed to their toll free number!). None of their local service centres listed in their website answers the phone. They have no record regarding the service request I made via their website (I got a confirmation mail). Finally when I did talk to service personnel via his personal phone, he quoted a repair charge which is almost equivalent to a new monitor price since they have to import the LED panel from Taiwan (or was he trying to get rid of me since it was a Friday evening :D The monitor is going straight to recycling eventhough it‚Äôs less than three months old and still in warranty period :-|

Below are some of the takeaways:
* Very nice monitor for your everyday use, BenQ got it right with their ambient light settings and low blue light technology
* Unlike some of the Samsungs and LGs out there, picture is not very vibrant
* Don't expect too much from audio dept; you are buying a monitor, not a sound bar
* When you buy this monitor, you pay for the hardware and not for the customer service

ps: we already ordered a BenQ 27 inch monitor",3
10749,157,"I was looking for a good and sturdy monitor and after long research, I came across Benq after reading good reviews so I thought let's give it a try. But it is really worth every penny because its built quality is very good and the base is very strong and sturdy. I was planning to buy Dell which was expensive and Benq was offering better prices but I am very happy with the purchase. It is not a gaming monitor but very good for office/home uses. I highly recommend this who is planning to buy a good monitor. There are option for lighting and adjustments which you can to according your needs. Overall a good experience so far.",5
10750,158,I'm been looking for a monitor for a while. But I'm got it now. This is a very good monitor in my opinion. Good color combination protects the eyes. I bought it mainly for video editing. I am completely satisfied with this. Thank you so much Amazon for providing such a product. Then there is the delivery of it. I'm so happy to have the item in hand so quickly. You do not have to look for another one in this budget. Thanks,5
10751,159,I didn't liked the skin resolution compared to Dell screen,4
10752,160,The picture quality is amazing and this is highly recommended for graphic designs,5
10753,161,"Specifications mentioned on the product page are correct.
Pros: (total 10 points)
1. IPS panel with 27 inch screen and FHD resolution. (+2 points)
2. No flaws in external hardware design, round corners, even level surface mat finish (yes i do check these things) (+2 points)
3. Multiple connectivity with vertical access (means connection ports parallels to screen) and Wall mount options available. (+2 Points)
4. Anti Glare coating, No dead pixel, Great color depth and contrast ratio, average thin Bessel, good response time. (+2 Points)
5. Cable management provided in table mount and separate button at bottom for screen config. (+2 points)
6. it has in-built speaker, expect only to play smooth music. (+1/2 point not considering in monitor category)
Cons: (total -5 points)
1. they provided auto bright adjust sensor in front side (mid bottom) but for me it was annoying for two reason. (-2 Points)
a. its not upto the mark.
b. i missed basic elegant rectangle design look (i would suggest to make it detachable)
2. external Power light at bottom right corner but since its not on front side and not a hard light and can be compensated by keeping dark object beneath it (-1 point)
3. Manual color and screen mode adjustment required to suit your viewing distance and content. Presets were not that helpful. (-2 point)

Overall (+5 points), Product Quality and offerings are really good and worth the price.
Thanks to Seller and Amazon for great delivery experience..",4
10754,162,"Picture quality of screen is satisfying, and in time delivery and safe packaging. Plug provided is big (like fridge size), make sure you have big power outlet for the monitor ready beforehand. No height adjustment or screen tilt, place on solid table if not wall mounted. It automatically adjusts brightness of screen depending on light in the room.",4
10755,163,Nice product,5
10756,164,"This review corresponds only to the requirement of 15A power-socket for the monitor; we did not get to use the monitor itself. It is difficult to understand the reason for 15A big-power plug supplied along with BenQ GW2780T monitor. As per the product information, it consumes a peak power of 32w which translates to ~0.15A (@220V). A 5A cable/power plug should suffice for this purpose and should be provided with the product. It is not feasible to create a 15A power socket in homes/offices for the purposes of a monitor.

The prompt response to take-back the returned monitor and initiation of refunding-action are highly appreciated.",3
10757,165,"I had double thoughts before purchasing this one as the reviews were mixed but i still went through it and glad that i didn't regret it.!

Man it's a beautiful stunning screen which I got for around 9450/-

It has a matte finish and has an adjustable tilt not much it is adjustable as per convenience. The assembly was easy and the stand is good and sturdy, also it is compatible for wall mount.

The colors are really very satisfactory and the brightness is adaptive. The panel is Anti glare and i work with a tube light behind me and have not faced any glare issues the display works like a charm.

The main reason I took this was for it's multiple connectivity as it has 1 HDMI 1 DP port 1 Vga 1 Audio Out 1 Head phone in.
I usually connect my Ps4 via HDMI and PC through the DP port and so the VGA is unused for me. There is also a panel behind for the organizing the wire efficiently.

There are inbuilt speakers 2W each which felt a bit disappointing as they are not that loud or not that much useful but the audio out port covers this issue.

It has some eye care protection function and can be turned on or controlled through the monitor itself.

I've had read many reviews on backlight bleeding and IPS panel issues it's been almost a month I'm using this monitor for about 12 to 14 hours but I've not faced anything like that yet. Also people tend to get confused with a IPS glow to backlight bleeding.

However I'm very happy with this monitor as it's a 24 inch one having multiple connectivity options and the display is delightful altogether this is far superior than the other in this price range.!!!!!!!",5
10758,166,"Latest update after 1-2 years:
After one year usage, a vertical line often appears in the middle of the screen, and it's quite annoying. I guess this product is not upto the mark. Forgot to update just after 1 year, but hope this will still be useful for some.
(my smaller size Dell monitor have no issues with such thing even after 7-8 years!)
******
Initial impression and review:

This monitor is cool in design with very small/thin border (which I usually prefer), picture clarity is good and size is big enough for editing works relating to photos, music or video (I'm not into games - no comments). The monitor speaker is just another add-on feature, thought it's not great. But I hardly use/rely on monitor speaker and it doesn't matter much.

Delivery is excellent - item delivered the next day even though I don't subscribe prime membership.

However, one issue I faced - the original item was somehow defective - only flash screen displayed but somehow works again. To ensure that I bought a non-defective item, I have requested for a replacement. Amazon as well as the seller sent a brand new replacement item immediately, which is working fine now. So, this issue is deemed to be resolved immediately.

Overall, it's worth buying at this price range.

About the durability and any pros & cons that comes along, I'll try to review once again after some time - at least after 6-12 months of use.",4
10759,167,Great product,5
10760,168,Very good monitor but after 3 days the screen starts getting foggy Picture quality is very good Benq is a trusted brand,5
10761,169,Best product,4
10762,170,"Good Monitor, Good Colors, Tites eyes if not in Eco Mode. Mediocre Speaker Quality, but manageable for small room in the nights for low volume musics and movies. Remember : There is no USB slot. That is very much inconvenience if u want to attach either headphones or Webcam or Mouse, there is not even one slot of USB A. Bad design in that matter.",4

 This product exclusive for software engineer, developer, programmer",5
10764,172,"Pros:
*A very good monitor for office work (programming, documenting etc).
*HDMI cable included.

Cons:
*In-built speakers are very weak and low on volume. Sound from them (on HDMI connection) is audible only upto 1.5ft from the screen and only in pin-drop silent room. Need external speaker even for video/audio meetings.
*Monitor is supplied with 16A power cord. Who uses 16A power supply for a LED monitor? Buy your own 6A power cord.

Manufacturer could have removed the speakers and reduced the price by 1K or so to compensate for feature drop and power cable.",4
10765,173,I m already using 24inch monitor of same brand. I m satisfied with functional quality. Hence ordered 27inch one. To my surprise it came with16A power plug unlike predecessor. I dont see that's highlighted in description. Now I m struggling to find 16A power point in my office room.Finally i got adaptor. I wish it should have been highlighted better,4
10766,174,"Earlier delivery and packaging was good even though there was a small tear on the outer delivery box, inside was packed with adequate thermocol, hence no damage to the product. Got monitor, HDMI cable, Power cable and monitor stand in the package.

It is very easy to assemble meaning connecting the monitor to the stand, I did it myself. That way, it is very user friendly.You can tilt the monitor but can't adjust the height.

This is good if you are into photo and video editing and requires a good monitor on a tight budget. It is IPS panel and LCD screen. It has one HDMI port, so you can cast using fire TV.
There are Readermode, multimedia mode etc in the monitor with preadjusted settings. I use it with my desktop and cellphone. Backlight bleeding is very less. Just play with adjustments and which one you are satisfied with. I am using for 4 days now and I had used auto settings, but I feel the light green color is excessive(may be it's just me) especially on skin tones, you can try adjusting it manually.

There are inbuilt speakers with this monitor(I decided to purchase this model because of that )but the speakers' sound is very feeble. It is better to connect an earphone /external speakers to the monitor through the audio in port.

This is a value for money monitor. Love it.",4
10767,175,"Good product, minus1 star due to incompatible power cable. Otherwise picture quality and response time is very good. You'd have to buy the power cable separately as they ship something that is too big for Indian power sockets.",4

10770,178,"Hi, This is my first order in Amazon. I am little skeptical in ordering online . However i had to take a chance because of this pandemic . Overall it was smooth experience. I am pleased to give a review comments on this BenQ 24'' Monitor. Overall happy , except few things that failed in below mentioned. Hope this helps to all. Thanks
Pros :
1. Delivered day before than expected date without any damages left which is awesome .
2. Features are same as they described
3. It is sleek , good looking
4. Easy to fix the stand without much efforts. It is sturdy too.
5. Viewing 178 degree angle is working good .
6. Easy to plugin to your laptop using HDMI cable that provided with this monitor
7. Fun watching movies / videos and office work on this monitor as it is enough size for both purposes.
Cons:
1. I wish they could deliver with extra wrap for preventing any damages/loss.
2. I feel it is emerging extra brightness even though i could adjust all settings. Because of the high brightness , i feel starting headache :(
3. I don't see Adoptive Brightness feature is working fine .
4. I feel the cost is little high because of the Adoptive brightness failure .
5. And Volume is not that great . They could offer good volume with this monitor as it is more expensive.",4
10771,179,"Got the 22in for my 4th grader son's online classes. Our 2nd Benq monitor. I trust the brand. Picture quality is decent and light bleeding is well within acceptable range for an entry level IPS panel. Looks good on the table with the slim bazel. The power cable that came in the box has a16amp plug top- for a monitor??? Don't remember ever seeing any personal computing hardware powered by a 16amp plug. No 16amp socket in house within reach, neither did I have a 5amp spare cable. To test the monitor I had to use the cable from my office setup. I am a little surprised by Benq's choice. Also they only included a vga cable and no hdmi. Overall happy with the performance but pulling 1 star due to mo hdmi supplied and the 16amp plug.",4
10772,180,Its been 1 month of use and not encountered any prob so far. Display is good and really helpful while working long hours.,5
10773,181,This is really excellent product by Benq. Quality build and easy handling. Screen quality is superior with good eye care technology.,5
10774,182,Nice monitor,5
10775,183,"Looked around for budget range of 24"" IPS FHD monitors and had these options - LG 24MPxxxx, Benq GW2480, Dell P2419H, SE2418H and an Acer variant. The Dell monitor seemed perfect fit when it came to features - height adjustment, USB 3.0 hub connectivity, rotation in addition to what I find in this Benq model. However, I found this display at a festival discount offer and the price difference made me purchase this model (INR 7.5k vs INR 12.5k).

1. Delivery experience : First time I had an experience of receiving a damaged product for an Amazon Order. But the resolution was smooth. I ordered a replacement online immediately after unpacking and the replacement was delivered within 2 days. Quite impressed with the service.

2. Display quality : Most people have already commented on display quality. The build quality seems decent, IPS display is beautiful at a viewing distance of 2-2.5ft, I enabled blue light filter at all times and it doesn't strain the eyes at all, cable management facility is neat - my desk is uncluttered and I find the Windows scaling setting at 100% ideal for my daily use. I do not game and neither am I into professional multimedia editing and I do not believe anyone who does one or both of these should even be considering this display. There are alternatives for those use cases.

3. Speaker : haven't used it and never used it with earlier monitors either. I hope people don't consider this an essential feature for monitors. It shouldn't be.

Overall a nice, economical upgrade to my 20"" 720p LCD monitor. I hope the product is as durable as my earlier monitors.",4
10776,184,"Been using it as my primary work monitor from a close distance, facing no issues.

Questions I had before buying:
- is the screen too big for 1080p
- the experience during reading / development (small texts)

After buying:
- the display is amazing.
- no issues in reading from close distance, using it from 1-2 feet distance, did not see pixels.
- viewing angles are off the charts, thanks to IPS panel for it, if you can see the screen from the side, you'll clearly see the picture from the side.",5
10777,185,"Picture clarity is great, a useful device for all the work from home population.",5
10778,186," The monitor is good. The speaker is good for playing background music while working. It is loud enough to watch movies. I'm using the monitor as my secondary monitor. The screen is bright and I prefer low brightness, I have to reduce it to 0. The packaging is very good. No damage. The only problem with this monitor is the 16Amp plug, which won't fit in any of the plug points. We have to purchase a separate converter 16A to 6A, which cost me 50 rupees. Please don't use non-authorized cables, which will damage the monitor. Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase.",5
10779,187,"Yes just like Xiaomi products. Cheap but good product.
I find the vga cable that comes along with this better than hdmi because it attaches firmly and vga cables are not as sensitive to degradation as hdmi. ( Strictly my opinion as I lost two within a few weeks).

You will appreciate the product.
I don't get ultra sharp text as I used vga cabel, I managed to increase the sharpness and it does the job for now. For hdmi you may get like picture quality like dell ( I haven't tried).

I would vote for this product on any given day.
Because it is
- cheap
- has decent anti glare
- good brightness
- excellent native blue light filtering
- good tilt adjustment angles vertically
- speakers are present ( haven't used them since vga doesn't transmit audio, if you use hdmi cable you will get the speakers to work)

This product is easily worth more than 8k.

We need companies building products like benq does for a moderate price.

If you need this for coding. Just hit the buy.
If need extra clarity, order a good hdmi cabel along side ( Amazon basics hdmi cable is good).

If your a gamer, then this review is not for you.
From what I heard on YouTube, it should do a good job but 60 Hz is the limit for refresh rate. So watch out if your games need more juice.

I hope this review of useful to you. Good day:)",5
10780,188,"Pros
1. It has a good viewing angle due to IPS technology.
2. It has its own night mode kind of Eye-care which is good.
3. At this price You won't get this specification in other brands like samsung and LG.

Cons
1. If you want a less bezel monitor. This is not a good choice
2. If you are planning to buy 2 pieces of this product and connect to play games , the bezel will irritate you. And hence not a good choice.
3. Black are not black in this monitor. I have hp elite book and I have a wallpaper of black color . Beleive me they appear far different on both screens ( my laptop and this monitor).
4 . Same as point number 3 , colors are not accurate. So , movie and gaming experience may be a bit low due refresh rate and color accuracy.

Final verdict.
If you searching for a monitor for office work like coding, browsing, MS office kind of work, Go for it . This is an excellent choice.
Don't buy for gaming and video/photo editing.",4
10781,189,"I'm writing this review after 4 months of usage.

Materials:
The build quality is superb, and I personally loved the ergonomics of this monitor.
This monitor can be rotated vertically for programming and also can be swiveled from the sides.
It can also be pivoted/tilted behind to align to your line of sight.
The stand helps you to also raise the monitor which can be a blessing in case you're a tall person.
The bezels are thin and I love them. They give a more sleek look.
I would definitely give a full 5 stars for the ergonomics of this monitor.

Picture quality:
Maximum resolution supported is 1920 x 1080.
This can output a FHD displaying via a good VGA cable, HDMI port and DVI port.
The picture quality is crisp and really good for programming, reading & multimedia.
The AI brightness technology is pretty good and automatically adjusts the screen brightness based on the room illumination.
Monitor has a lot of features in the menu, which I find pretty crazy/good.
If you are not a professional gamer, you wouldn't really notice the difference in the refresh rates.

Warranty & support:
Benq support team is really good and actually respond to your requests swiftly. I had some issue with the monitor for which I contacted the Benq team and got it resolved within a matter of days. FYI, this monitor has a 3 years warranty and I would definitely recommend this product.",5
10782,190,"Almost no glare. Needed that because I sit next to a window. Sound isn't great, but it has a headphone jack so that's okay. It is decent enough but I really wish adjusting the height of the screen was possible. It is something they could've put in at this cost.",4

1 backlight bleed ,a lot of
2 washed out colors. My one plus y tv in11k screen is 4x much good than this
3. Eye irritation in just 15 min all settings tried
4. Brightness intelligence is a big scam
Even in the darker room lowest brightness is like 50 perc with 10000years old bi technology.
I buyed it for coding but white screen hurts a lot
Its like you are watching small white led lights

Very uncomfortable in watching ,,
And the worst thing is that i want to replace and amazon not picking up call neither calling me back whole day passed like this also their in app replace button working . . 2 days passed
And all the modes like reader mode multimedia office are just setting + antiflicker and blue light filter you get in 99 percent of the monitors today without even highlighting
Never go for benq
Stay away from this old thing
I will keep trying to replace it for all the 7 days thank you

10790,198,"This monitor has met all the features that I need for it's price. Here is my review for Benq GW2780.

The good -
- The monitor is well built and beautifully designed with all the matte surface and textured plastic. It looks clean and simple.
- I am very happy to find no Backlight Bleed at any part of my monitor which is very prominent among IPS panel based monitors. There is just the ""IPS glow"" which is completely normal for an IPS panel.
- The viewing angles are excellent.
- The monitor size (27 inches) is big enough for all the entertainment needs.
- It has a popular and standard resolution of 1920x1080 (Full HD). I'd say that this resolution for a 27 inch monitor with 81 PPI (Pixels per inch) isn't really that bad, which means it is good enough for text based content and other entertainment.
- It has some inbuilt features called the ""Low Blue Light"" mode and ""Brightness Intelligence"", which works great in reducing strain if you work for several hours. Brightness Intelligence feature automatically adjusts the monitor's brightness by sensing the lighting conditions in the room without needing to change the brightness manually.
- Many connectivity options including the DisplayPort, two HDMI ports and an audio port.
- The pixel response times are really good. You can find no issues in fast paced FPS Games.

The bad -
- The inbuilt speakers sound really low.
- There is some weird bug in the OSD (On-screen Display) menu of the monitor, where changing the Gamma value doesn't change anything in the picture. But, it doesn't really matter because the default Gamma value is the standard anyway.

Conclusion - This is a nice, all feature packed PC Monitor for it's price, you will never find in other monitors, at least for now. You can go for it!",4
10791,199,Worth to buy for homeoffice work,4
10792,200,"I purchased this for my WFH Responsibilities and I am fully satisfied with this product.
It has multiple viewing modes and its adjustable heights is a delightful feature.

Since I would be using this for only work, so very high resolutions was not needed for me.
One issue I had initially was that the plug provided for this was a huge one, which I think is used in Air Conditioners, I had to use another power cord.
Besides this minor hiccup, This is amazing product.
Aamzing delivery by amazon. Got the product within 24 hrs in Pune.

Go for it...",4
10793,201,"Bought it for my Dell XPS laptop so that I can have a bigger screen. The build is solid and the cable management is great. The monitor stand is also very good as the monitor does not tip over easily. Max resolution is 1920 so don't expect it to have a greater area like a 4K monitor.

Less one star as I had to do a lot of calibration for colour. The inbuilt modes are not great. I had to switch to user defined mode and calibrate the colour a lot. Finally after 1 hour of fiddling with the modes and settings of the monitor, I was able to get the right colour.

Since it is an LCD monitor (not LED), the font on windows 10 look blurry. You need to set the cleartype option in the windows settings so that you get sharp fonts. Do not compare it with other high end monitors like gaming or photo editing. They are better but more expensive.

If you are looking for a bigger area to work on, buy a monitor which supports 1440 or higher resolution. Note the resolution also depends on the graphics card support. If you have a 4K monitor but the graphics card does not support it, any monitor will run on max 1920 resolution.

For daily use like word processing and programming, this monitor is great especially the cable management and back side design.",4
10794,202,You don't buy this monitor because it's warranty is not claim you and they're don't reply if you asked our warranty,4

1) they shipped it with power three pin plug with M type socket. And now I am not able to put it my work table. No have to either buy a 5A power cable or a 5A to 15A power plug. Which means extra cost.

2) speaker arenot at all good. It's almost it's not there. Sound is so low that I barely can hear it at full volume.",4
10797,205,"Build quality is good. Packaged with all kind of accessories like wall mount/cable management etc.

Absolutely no backlight bleeding.

Viewing angle is very good

27"" screen looks really well. With windows 10 full hd resolution, you get lot of extra real estate screen to multitask.

Speakers are okay, don't expect too much

I use it to work from home. In office, I used to have dual monitor setup. This cannot replace that experience but big screen is better for your eyes and for reading as well as for multimedia experience.

Freesync is not supported but works well with basic gaming like ping/cs/COD etc..
I have 4k freesync supported 55"" samsung qled tv for gaming so don't want freesync support in monitor.

Using this with low blue light mode which slightly impacts color calibration but I am fine with it. You can change the mode though as per your need.

It has inbuilt light sensor which works but reacts too fast. I have disabled those as my ambient light does not fluctuate that much.

Matt finish and no glaring.

Power usage is very less

Go for it if not a hard-core gamer. It's best value for money package under 13,500/-.",4

3. Anti glare

5. No faulty pixels
6. Headphone out and Audio in jack
7. 2 HDMI ports are available
8. HDMI cable is available with it

Cons:
1. Inbuilt speaker quality is not of good quality -- use a Bluetooth speaker or other speakers using the headphone jack behind the monitor
2. Instead of VGA, type C port would have been good ;-) -- never used VGA till now

Hence Recommending it to be used for as a TV for small rooms, office use and casual gamers",5
10800,208,"I am using this as my second monitor - to replicate the dual-monitor setup at office. This is my 2nd BenQ monitor - the first one was bought over 6 years ago, but was TN type, with poor viewing angles and marked color shift when viewed from any angle other than straight ahead. The older monitor works otherwise, but the control panel buttons are misbehaving now. I am unable to change many of the settings, including Blue light.

This monitor, being an IPS panel, does not suffer from any of these shortcomings. The images are very crisp, clear and with natural colors. It has a wide viewing angle, being an IPS panel. Having blue-light reduction feature helps reduce strain on the eyes. The design is very slim and sleek - very think bezels. It supports full HD resolution.
The screen has matte finish, so there is no issue of glare.
Note: the monitor stand supports only vertical/side-ways adjustment - there is no height adjustment. You will need to pay more if you need this feature.
I use it for office related work mostly, video conferencing, and occassional entertainment - watching YouTube or videos.
I have not used it for gaming and have no experience evaluating it for gaming purposes.
All in all, this a very good buy, perfectly suitable for average users.",5

Can anyone suggest 16 amp power cable is really necessary for this monitor or a 6 amp will do?, I am really surprised!!!, it's a headache now to buy another power cable to use the monitor!!! Or.... I have to call electrician to change my house wiring to 16 amp to make this monitor work!!!.",3
10802,210,"As a monitor, have nothing to complain at all. Looks elegant and have nice picture quality.

The only thing I did not like are the in-built speakers which are very poor quality and also too low in volume. I did not expect deep bass, but at least the voice/treble should have been louder. We can watch news or likewise on youtube, when sitting within 3 feet of monitor, but not further. And not suitable at all for music or movies. I take one star off for the poor speakers.

The brightness intelligence feature: The sensor captures direct/directional light falling on it, and not room ambient light. My room is such that the room light (LED tube light) is directly behind me, and a slight shadow falls on the monitor's light sensor, such that the monitor thinks the room is darker than it really is, and dims the brightness. So finally, had to keep the sensor auto brightness feature off.",4
10803,211,"Purchased exactly an year ago for Rs. 12840 on little sale. Now price is showing Rs. 15890.
Though I won't buy it for more than Rs. 13500
Pros-
Good pciture quality
No backlighting issue
Build quality is good.
Not too heavy not too light.
No misuse of space on corners.
Easy to clean.

Cons-
Light sensor doesn't work properly and is not very sensitive. Has only 2-3 brightness modes which are also not very different from each other so of no use.
Mounting a camera on top of it is difficult as it's convex curved from behind.
No extra HDMI port.
No pendrive port
Sound is too low.

Overall, go for it without a second thought. I don't have big table as this monitor itself is big enough i.e. 27inch otherwise would have bought 1 more for dual monitor experience.",5
10804,212,"Display: I bought this monitor as a secondary display to aid my programming. The text display in Windows 10 is awfully pixelated and not at all crisp. If you are buying this for text based usage, strictly stay away. I can't emphasize more. All the other display related features are absolutely miserable.
Sound: The less we talk the better. The speaker volume and quality is fit for nothing absolutely pathetic sound. I don't know why this feature exists.
The Bomb: You cannot return, can only replace. No matter how you try the display is ending up being garbage

The trouble we had was with the power cord. They had shipped a power cord with 15A plug. What is needed for all home appliances is a cord with 5A plug since most of the sockets are 5A sockets. Amazon refused to replace the cord.

We had to buy the power cord separately.",4

The picture quality is very good, especially for the price, and after the calibration the images looks almost as good as on my 20K+ LG Ultrawide monitor. There's no issues viewing from sides as well. The thing bezel design also makes it attractive, especially for a multi-monitor setup. The anti-glare coating is also a good thing. It takes 3-4 secs extra to turn on when compared with the LG. There are many configurable options and adjustments to be made, but using the buttons are not very easy. A joystick based navigation control would've been better. There are inbuilt speakers, but they are a big let down. Should is muffled and even a ~1000 INR Bluetooth speaker will produce better sound.

this is for my Office work setup for 9++++ hours continues work , I have habit of dual monitor in Office, which was kind of missing from very long as I am WFH but as everyone know this so called WFH exhausted full day and night life, working in laptop continuously would not help me to get productive and making my back and eye tired,

now this armament will help me with good visibility and work potential.
Good quality of product form BENQ and very surprising Super fast delivery form amazon in the just next day of order for this Monitor.
very thin bezels and quality screen visibility
soft to eye and light for pocket when compare with competitor
monitor is adjustable from neck for up and down but not shift up and down which believe me you don't needed.
must recommend this product go for it and great service form Amazon",4
10810,218,"Great monitor for the price. I could achieve a massive +27 hz overclock (with some tweaking in nvidia control panel) bringing the refresh rate to 87 hz which is amazing for the price, but maybe not every monitor can do that and I just got lucky. Certainly expect ~75 hz overclocks at 1080p for this monitor for any unit at least, which would be much better for PC gaming.

Now, picture quality is another deal, everything except color temperature was fine on my unit. I had an awful red tint on mine, but with the built in color temperature settings I could offset that pretty well using my galaxy s8's much better calibrated screen as a template and going by eye. Not everybody will have something like that or the patience to correct it themselves, so picture quality gets a 3.5/5 for me, because it seems like a lottery on who will get a correctly tinted monitor. (P.S. BenQ has a color profile in their website for this model, which helped reduce the tint and make it more accurate by a little bit in windows, but definitely not as good as 'correct' looking as a manual calibration by eye in my opinion, and it also doesn't work if you use a console as a second input or just something without .icc color profile support)

Brightness is, well, as good as you'll get at this pricepoint. It's as bright as my older but more expensive Acer monitor, maybe 'bright' isn't the right word for it, but it gets the job done even in a well lit room for my use case.

Even with the tint issue, I personally think this thing deserves a 4 stars solely due to the value proposition, but in my case, with such a massive boost in refresh rate, I think 5 stars is well deserved.",5

 Update on 14th June : After writing my Last review on 3rd June I got a Call from Deepak (from BenQ HQ Gurgaon) very next day and offered to replace within a Week as they figured out my Monitor has some Panel issues. The New monitor received as a replacement works like a Charm. Kudos to BenQ team.

1st Review : 3rd June
[Refer the Video attached] When the new Monitor arrived it was working fine - however after using continuously for 6 month for WFH it started showing Rectangular Rings and Frequent Flickering around the Screen Border. I contacted the BenQ support and they said this issue is common with BenQ and it will go away after sometime. AND yes this issue did go after 3-4 hrs and screen as good as earlier. BUT after one this issue again came and nowadays it is too frequent which hampers the WFH productivity. This issue is so uncertain that it can came during you meeting presentation or while watching movies. Lets hope BenQ provides a replacement.",5
10816,224,"Short review.
Pros:
Good display quality.
Overclockable to 75 hz easily by nvidia control panel.
Looks beautiful with thin bezels( best looking in segment)
Taiwanese brand.
Cons:
Useless vga cable in box.
Navigation buttons on montior are not easy to use.
Unnecessary 15 ampere plug, majority will be needing an 5 amp to 15 amp converter . That's additional headache.
That's all for now .
21.5 inch is best size for 1080p. Screen resolution in 21.5 inch is like amoloed feeling.",4
10817,225,"I know you guys must be wondering why my review title says ""Dont buy"" but I have given 4 star rating to this product. It's because this product comes with a 16A 150V power adapter. In usual cases we do not have 16A power output available to work with monitors. So please make sure you have 16A 250V plug point available. I had to purchase separate power cord to work with this monitor. Also, in the description it was not mentioned that it requires higher volt output plug which was a conflict because the product was not returnable only exchangeable.",4

The only thing I regret sometimes is that i should have bought 24 instead of 27 inch for FHD as sometimes, I see pixel breaking up in image.",4
10819,227,"Using for editing, multimedia, colour grading this is the best monitor for editing",5
10820,228,"This is an excellent product. I knew it has no height adjustment and thought it'll not be a deal breaker, however now I can not reduce it's height (one can at least increase the height by putting some support at the bottom). If this is not a deal breaker to you, then go for it. Speaker quality is good. Audio clarity is not good for video calls since it seems it is optimized for multimedia audio (treble is not that great). Hence when I do not want to use headphone, I switch speaker to my laptop instead of this monitor.
The most imp factor to me was the eye care feature, which is working very well with this monitor. There was no eye strain once started using this monitor in spite of long working hours (I keep eye care always on, not just at night).",4
10821,229,"So I required a Monitor for some Editing work and my budget was 10K.
After thorough research, I decided to go with this one.
For Rs. 8999, I think it was the best deal I got.

Here is my review after a week of its use.

Pros -
* First of all the price. you cannot get a good branded 24 Inch monitor at this rate.
* Colors are good and look good.
* Prompt to open and easy to install.
* Soft on eyes and does not give you headache even after long use.

Cons -
* It hangs sometimes.
* Mouse stops working when connected to Monitor, but occasionally.
* Brightness is not up to mark.
* The speakers are the worst that you can get. They are there just for the namesake. You need external speakers or use the other device.

I know that Dell Monitors are the best but they were quite pricey and I needed a big screen with good colour quality and a brand to back up with.

I have most of my expectations with this monitor
.
Despite few shortcomings, I think it is the best monitor in the market and you don't have to worry about buying it.",4
10822,230,"The monitor works with both MacOS and Ubuntu as I have connected to both and they worked seamlessly. In case of connecting to Mac need a HDMI to USB-C adapter.
The monitor is really good for the current work from home situation. I initially had planned to order a mountable monitor with a separate mountable arm to use for the monitor and my laptop. As the mount was currently not available, decided to order this monitor with the adjustable height stand. The stand can keep the top of the monitor adjustable between 15 and 21 inches above the table level. I found this more than enough to get it up to my eye level. The monitor came packaged in a relatively eco-friendly packing.
The picture quality is fine and I think could work as a backup TV for me to watch anything online if the TV is occupied. The sound quality is decent for an in-built one.
The only negative so far I found is a dead pixel on the screen towards the right side of the screen. Don't think its worth trying to get the monitor replaced for that one pixel. The only thing missing probably is a inbuilt camera/microphone.",5
10823,231,"Play Video
 This is my favorite monitor",5
10824,232,"This monitor is great if you know what you're getting into.

First off let me start by saying that the factory settings on the monitor's features are not the best, the ""sharpness"" is cranked up the intelligent brightness control seems to be off so make sure you turn it on and set sharpness to zero or text can look funny.

At this screen size and viewing distance of about an arms length 1080p is just barely passable I really wish I could have gone for a 4k option which I highly recommend if you're gonna be coding on this thing. I paired it with a pivotable vesa mount to let me use it in portrait mode as well and it's going great.

This is not by any stretch of the imagination a gaming monitor that being said light gaming is acceptable on any display with reasonable brightness and >60 hz refresh rate

otherwise the massive screen real estate is much appreciated at this price point and the automatic brightness adjustment is extra cherries on top, my room has many windows and it gets bright in here during the day and dark at night and i don't need to fiddle with the brightness settings ever. and the glare from windows is practically non existant so kudos to Benq for making a great product",5
10825,233,"I got this Monitor for 12499( 27"" Model), and it has been a few months since I am using it.

It is used primarily for Office work, and for some gaming.

Pros :
Clarity : The texts are sharp and clear, and there is no issue with visibility. I do not have to peek into the monitor to read, like I had to do on the laptop.

Brightness : The monitor gets pretty bright. So much so that I keep it at 30% Brightness.

SIze : 27"" is a pretty good size.

Color Reproduction : Colors are pretty sharp, and you can select from multiple color profiles from within the monitor. I am currently playing Witcher 3 and the colors are splendid. Though this might not be a good monitor for FPS gaming, because of the response time 5ms. But it is good for games like GTA, Witcher, RDR that do not require precision.

Cons :

The speakers are pathetic. Even the HDMI Passthrough for Audio Circuit is pathetic. Speakers connected to laptop have much better audio that when connected to AUX port on the monitor. Though no minus points for it, since it is just an add on, and not a selling feautre.",5

I would recommend buying a monitor arm as well to feel safe while working in case table moves.
Overall good quality product. Recommended to buy",4
10829,237,"The monitor display quality is superb. It can be rotated allowing vertical layout. But the speaker is poor, low volume and audio quality is bad.",4
10830,238,"First Things First:

You need to activate the Eye Care feature in the monitor. It is not ""ON"" by default. I realised it after 3-4 months of usage! :/

Replacement under warranty:

My initial monitor developed a vertical line after 3 months of usage. No particular reasons for the line. Raised a complain with the BenQ customer care in their prescribed format. They immediately accepted the fault and agreed to replace the monitor under warranty.

Got the replacement of the monitor in 4-5 working days. No hassles, no paperwork. Appreciate the quick and professional response.

Coming to the monitor:
My usage is extensively for work purpose and seldom for watching movies.

This monitor meets both my requirement. The Anti-glare feature is particularly impressive. I also work late at night, with the lights switched off. The monitor auto adjusts the display brightness according to the light in the room. However, this feature has to be activated from the menu in the monitor.

Overall - Go for it if you are looking to buy for work purpose and little bit of videos/multimedia.",5
10831,239,"Good deal. One of the best deals you would get when looking for cheaper office monitors. I bought it for 8000. I like it very much till now (almost a month of usage). Picture quality is good and comes with many diaplay modes and blue light filter. Sensor to detect brightness (for auto detect) is a good value add.

Being said that, there are some flaws. Most disappointing thing for me is that my monitor flickers once in a while. Very occasional, but it happens. Happened 3 times till now. Secondly, the earphones socket is very very difficult to reach out to. If you are not removing it often, then no issues. But otherwise, it's a definite problem. For a guy like me who uses one earphone for phone and laptop, it's annoying.

Nonetheless, cheaper and decent quality.",4
10832,240,"The contrast is quite low, the blacks are not deep, they look look grey, not even dark grey so it is not that good for media consumption but if you want a big monitor for office work then it does the job. Also 1080p resolution in this size means the display won't be that sharp. I'd suggest a 2k display for 24+ inches.
Antiglare is good",3
10833,241,"This monitor is magic!

I had an old Lenovo monitor (19'') which caused immense strain on my eyes and they would water frequently. I also have an high degree of myopia. I mainly do coding work and my laptop screen also strained my eyes very much, also being just 15.6''. So the 'eye-care tech' caught my attention and Benq being a trusted old brand, I ordered this (21.5'').

And my oh my, this monitor has worked wonders. I sit straight for 12-13 hours before the screen and my eyes don't feel a thing, earlier which used to water within 30-45 minutes of screen time!

The picture quality is crisp and vibrant and the brightness goes very high, but I always keep it in the Low-Blue Light mode which automatically reduces the max brightness.

I used the auto-brightness Eye Care feature based on ambient light sensing for a few days, which most of the time worked fine, but eventually shifted to manual mode as I preferred constant low brightness. But the colours are equally vibrant on all brightness levels.

I played some CS GO and was shocked to see the colour difference between my 2014 laptop (Lenovo Z50-70 1080p) screen and this monitor. I have hooked the monitor to the laptop via HDMI cable (not provided with the 21.5'' model, only VGA cable is provided). The response rate seems good enough, but I eventually stopped playing just because my laptop GPU specs aren't good enough.

The design is modern and sleek, slim-bezel.

Verdict: Perfect for the price, eye-care tech is a wonder.",5
10834,242,Good,5

The 27"" display is large enough, it's perfect for providing enough screen real-estate and the need for an extended laptop monitor is not required at-least in my opinion.

The monitor has a light sensor below the BENQ logo which can adjust the brightness, but it is not useful for me at-least as my seating position does not have much of varying lighting conditions. Others may find it useful though. Please remove the plastic film over the light sensor so that it works properly.

So, put this monitor, a desk mount and a desk mat in my wishlist and waited for the Prime Day sale. Really happy with the setup.

Coming to the monitor, the size is perfect for me. The various blue light filter modes are good. I primarily use the 'Office' mode, and change to 'Media' mode while watching movies.
The four navigation buttons on the bottom right corner are very convenient and the configurable settings offered are more than enough for basic office work and some simple editing.

I told them that the new monitor is still being sold on Amazon for Rs. 13999/- (the rate at that time). I then got to know that this company doesn't have any support mechanism at all in India. And that's why they are quoting a price that is not acceptable to their customers at all. Their moto is just selling and not servicing. You will not face this issue with big brands like LG, Samsung, HP, Dell, Acer, etc. Their spare parts cost reasonable. Screen replacement cost is something around Rs. 6000 to 8000 for 27 inch monitor. But for these cheap brands, this costs more than the actual price of monitors. Shame on BenQ. My advice is go for big brands. They also cost same but their after sale service is heavenly not like this cheap BenQ.",1

It is loud enough for music and videos viewed from 1 to 2 mtrs. It has headphone output too. The display panel is IPS with very good viewing angles and a good response time. Good for games too. The build quality is also good and it looks stylish with very small bezel. My previous monitor was also Benq which lasted 12 years. I hope this one will too last that long. Just go for it. Note the 24"" version does not have 2 HDMI ports, it has 1 HDMI and 1 Digital Display. Hence if u want 2 HDMI ports then go for22"" monitor.",5
10869,277,"Unit had panel issues within the warranty period and BenQ clearly denied service, they said to buy a new panel, they say the warranty is for 3 monthly only, where as the product description clearly mentions 39 months.
Amazon days to deal with brand. No one is bothering to fix the issue.

After sales service continues to be a joke in India, once the company sells you the product it's your issue now. Absolutely shameful behavior.",1

10871,279,"Just received this monitor 2 days back. Assembling the monitor is very easy. Only 2 parts. I experience no fatigue while working unlike my laptop. Overall Good for working and studying. Height adjusting is also good.
But on the downside, it occupies space behind the screen, so make sure your study table has enough width.
I tested in dark room and bright lit room, there is only limited change in brightness when in dark room. I have expected iPhone like sensitivity. (May be I am wrong as I need to explore some more features)
Packing received from Amazon is teared when I had received it. But there is no damage to monitor box. I hope this monitor will last for a longer duration.",4

Do not consider the speakers as a feature. Works sporadically on windows 10 via HDMI. Also the volume is very very low.

Laptops have higer volume.",4

10874,282,"Cheap rebranded Chinese monitor. The product seems fine at first but has many flaws and you should stay away or buy from other brands.
The being a cheap Chinese rebranded panel so no ounce of money was spent on the r&d of this model so dust and dirt get in even if the panel is kept in an AC environment. I have been using it in a very clean environment in a metro like Mumbai but still, the dust has got in.
There are so many gaps in the body that a bug/fly has gone in and is stuck inside and the BenQ service refuses to even see it.
Why I am sure there have been multiple instances of the specific problem I had? --> Because the specific clause is written in the BenQ service warranty
""BenQ may invalidate a warranty claim including but are not limited to the following:
For any bug/dust/dirt that appeared on the panel (blackish/greyish)""

(*Also it is so slow while starting, takes a lot of time for the branded logo to go, and can't even disable it, I could have lived with this if it hadn't been for a huge bug in the middle of the screen)

Please don't make the same mistakes I did and stay away from this monitor.",1
10875,283," First i was confused between Lg, hp, and benq. Then when it comes the versatility and performance i believe benq is best brand not only for this one but all kind of of your monitor requirements.
Price might be 500-1k higher in similar range, but its worthy.everything like wall mount, audio in and out, vga, power cable with out adapter, cable management is there.
What i got:
1.Black levels are almost like oled, its great for an ips panel (see video).
2. Covers RGB, low blue light mode is great. Almost retina from 2 feet.
3. Benq is solid buid, low weighing monitors (asus) shake even on using buttons.
4.Recommended for binge watch and surfing and PPT and assignments stuff.
5. Very great use for TN dispaly laptop extension.
If you have 9k , don't think twice just get it.

Ps: *used asus vz229 no audio out no wall mount.
Used lg 24 inch, got burn screen issue in two years.

Only Con is sound is low but accepted as its a monitor not tv.",5
10876,284,"Amazing budget monitor. I got the 24 inch which was perfect for my small table. I mostly use it for coding and the text is sharp and visible.

In order to get the most benifits, you do need to change the default settings a bit and customize to your preference. You'll be able to find YouTube videos and guides online on how to get the best picture quality.

I've also really appreciated the auto-brightness feature which adapts the brightness to the amount of light in the environment. It's not always perfect but you can tweak the sensitivity in the settings.

Overall a great monitor for the price. Will definitely recommend.",5
10877,285,"Good for coding as it ips display it help is reading text.
Rest of the monitor in this price range have thick Bessel which is annoying but benq has very small bezel which is a plus.

Pros:
1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's
from dell.
2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.
3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that
4. Brightness is way too much high

Cons
1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)

At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.
if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you.",4

 I have used many monitors like Dell LG HP Acer and had a good experience with LG and Acer and never liked HP and Dell.

As I am not a serious gamer I use these monitors for programming and reading (sometimes I play games a bit).

This 27 inch monitor is the best for multitasking as it's a huge screen and you can easily perform 4 task at a time.

This has a good viewing angles. The texts and images appear sharp.

There is only one con that I have seen till now is that it has some I mean very less light bleeding. So yeah even 30k-40k have that.

You can hear to the song that I played for you. This monitor has nice inbuilt speakers which are pointed downwards. No complaints can be made according to the price of the monitor.

I think it's the best monitor monitor you can get at this price range.

You can check other monitors with similar features will be around 16-20k. I got this for exact 13993.

Kudos to BenQ and Amazon for that‚ù§‚ù§",5

10885,293,"Absolutely loved the monitor! I was looking for a monitor under 10k which would serve the purposes for office work, gaming as well as entertainment and this monitor perfectly fits for the same.
Before buying this one I did an extensive research on the monitors available in the market but this BenQ model wins it.
Have been using it for more than a month without any issues.
It came in nice packaging and did not observe any damages.
The picture colours are truly awesome and very well defined.
The only thing that I find lacking is the option for an additional HDMI port as this has only one since I keep switching between my laptop and desktop. But that is not a major issue.
If you are looking for a budget all purpose monitor, I'll recommend this one for sure.
Note: Don't rely on the monitor speaker as they are actually of no use. You'll eventually have to connect external speakers.",5

Couple of things to note:
1) You don‚Äôt get an HDMI cable with it. Only VGA is included in the box.

This is the full review of this monitor and lets just do with in the box contents, Pros, Cons and finally the Conclusion.
Feel free to checkout my profile.
-------------------------------------------------
IN THE BOX CONTENTS
-------------------------------------------------
1. Some manuals with one CD.
2. Power Cable.

4. Monitor itself.

---------------------------------------------
PROS OF THIS MONITOR
--------------------------------------------
1. It comes with a great design and those bezels, I love them because it looks so awesome at looking at that full screen with that almost bezel free design.
2. The viewing experience is just great. This display produces very nice colors and with the IPS LED display it is almost perfect to view from sides.
3. There are also inbuilt speakers and for this kind of design and price they just sounds nice.
4. It comes with HDMI, VGA and Display port input.
5. One of the best feature that I like id that cable management system. Every cable hides perfectly under that cover for cables.
6. There is also a feature of automatic brightness and it works really fine in this monitor.
7. The display quality is just remarkable and it is flicker free display.
8. The stand of this laptop has a great textured design and the same texture is on the back of this monitor.

-------------------------------------------
CONS OF THIS MONITOR
-------------------------------------------
The only thing that I did not liked it that it does not come with the VGA cable in the box.

CONCLUSION: Finally, It is a great monitor. Comes with almost bezel free design, Automatic brightness, wall mounting and other great features. For these all I think this kind of price is just fine and it makes the way to my great buying list and I am happy with it.",5
10899,307,This monitor fulfils all my need. Picture quality is very good. Size of screen is also fine. The only drawback is the electric plug provided with it is of 16 Amp which will not fit in 5 Amp plug. So you have to purchase multiplug to convert 5 amp to 16 amp if you don‚Äôt have 16 amp socket in your room.,5
10900,308,Good monitor and recommend for all,5
10901,309,"All those reviews were right. The plug really IS big and won't fit into your normal socket. So unless you have a 15 to 5 amps adapter idling at home, you'd better order one along with the monitor. I am contemplating sending this one back over this issue and get a refund. This monitor is just a huge paperweight until I receive the adapter I ordered last night. I don't understand how a brand like benq cannot listen to so many customer complaints - all related to the same plug issue. But otherwise, I don't think there's anything else to worry about the monitor - it offers a very good, very huge display, no blurring, etc - overall a brilliant gadget, from whatever I was able to test using a borrowed adapter.",3
10902,310,It is too early to judge the products. 60 days is completed so far so good and I trust Amazon. Planned to buy two more after 6 months from now.,5
10903,311,"Size of this monitor is good enough for home / office use. It's an excellent product baring the sound. Sound clarity isn't loud enough to hear clearly. I haven't played any games on it but for watching films, home / office use it's an excellent pick. Above all the price is affordable. Probably at this price you may not get AMD sync, clear and crisp sound. But it has eye care technology which is very useful for those use this for home / office use. Make note though it has HDMI port, HDMI cable isn't included in the package.",5
10904,312,"Product does not come with HDMI cable and the power plug needs 16amps socket which is commonly used for A/Cs and Geysers and not for other common electric appliances. Needed to replace the existing one with a new 16amps socket after failing to make the Amazon customer service understand the problem and see if any possibility of getting another cable with low amp power plug. One needs to add these additional expenses .

Apart from above it looks to be a good product as of now.",4
10905,313,"My first buy of a BenQ product. Though I knew the Qisda the holder of this brand I have never worked on BenQ monitors before. I purchased seeing the flicker free and eye care ads on this product with a great pricing. Well the buy is not disappointing. The product looks and works exactly as advertised. Most plus are very little glare, and the auto settings feature. With auto-settings enabled, it adapts to the lighting conditions around and making it comfortable. The only caveat with that is, when switched ON, it starts with full brightness and you will need to look somewhere away anticipating that. In a second or two it will be brought in to control, but that should have been set in the other way - start with medium brightness/contrast level and then adjust it to optimal level. This can be fixed with a firmware update - I hope BenQ will have to address this as soon as possible. On the other hand, the sound on the monitor - just don't expect any good. You have two speakers for just to have it. It is not loud enough and not any good quality sound to hear from it as well.",5
10906,314,"The monitor is excellent for office purpose , I am watching movies once in a while , the Colors are very subtle and beautiful, a friend of mine who works as cinematographer in movie industry said that the Color reproduction is very good after seeing a movie in benq monitor ...",5
10907,315,"My requirements are good screen clarity, height adjust-ability, chrome-cast connectivity and a simple speaker. Benq is quite thoughtful in its design thinking about its customers.
Screen clarity is quite good.

Height adjusting is very easy. you just move the monitor along the arm.
Height adjust-ability is a must if you use a laptop to connect and using both monitors.

One disadvantage I think is having only one HDMI port. They should've added at least two.

Overall I will recommend this.",4
10908,316,"Over the past 1 year, I've bought this monitor thrice.
I'm using a 4 desk setup, and till now, everything was fine.

Now, when I purchased this monitor yet again (same one as before)
I got a huge power socket with it, unlike ever before.

It's as huge as the one used for geysers, ovens and AC. It won't fit into my spike guard, or any other switch in my room.

I'll have to either install a new switch, or replace the power cord.

The first two times when I'd purchased, this wasn't the case and I received proper cord that'd fit into normal Indian sockets.",5
10909,317,"I was using my old 15"" LG monitor for last 17 years, continuously along with designing work.
But at last just before few weeks, monitor started giving ""Picture Distortion"".
So i started just roaming around on YouTube + Amazon for new monitor. At the same time i decided big screen size too.
Finlay i landed up on __BenQ__ . and my decision was 100% right to fulfill my requirements

It's pricing is 100% justified, that gives me Full relaxing satisfaction.

If someone wants to Buy, Just don't run after Branded ones.Get __BenQ__.",5
10910,318,"I purchased this Monitor a week back and happy with the performance. Little disappointed with it's speaker because sound is very feeble and not able to use it, so you have to purchase external speaker if you would like to use it for some purpose. As it meets my purpose So 5 star. I am generally using it for office work purpose, so no problem for me. As I need to work continuously for 9 hours it provide relax to my eyes. Thanks to this monitor's eye care system. Brightness sensor is working well and automatically adjust brightness as per surrounding . all wires are passing through it's stand holder, so no mess of wires on my desk. It's boarder-less look from all 3 sides makes it beautiful I found all features same as per Amazon's description about the product. Thank you.",5
10911,319,"I bought this monitor some time ago and hence, I think that BenQ may have discontinued with this monitor model.

Overall, my experience with this monitor is very good. No harm in investing in this monitor. One of the important feature that the monitor has is to adjust brightness based on ambient light. I find that very handy.",4
10912,320,"Great Value Product

When I received the product, the box was damaged which was a clear indication that monitor might also be damaged and that is what exactly resulted. The monitor received was damaged as shown in the attached photo. Cleary there were quality checks missing that is the reason i got a damaged monitor.
==============
After receiving a new product via replacement, i am actually satisfied with the monitor.

Pros:
1.Auto brightness
2.Headphone Jack
3.HD resolution is enough for me as i am using mainly for work.
4.Build Quality is nice by that i mean to say is the stand is sturdy and screen doesn‚Äôt shake until and unless someone purposely shakes it.

Note- At the time of pick up of damaged monitor(which was the very next day) , the guy had already come with a new one.",5
10913,321,"No bleeding issue so far,
Value for money display,
Inbuilt Speakers are useless, I don't know why company bothered to put them.

Overall good monitor",4
10914,322,"After a lot of research, I found this monitor. It is perfect for regular reading and my office work. I was earlier thinking to go for 27'' model, but chose this rather. There's a lot of screen real-estate and the slim bezels are cherry on top of the cake. I really am impressed with how good the product turned out to be. If you are into content creation, video editing, media creation, or you are coding enthusiast, you would appreciate the product. Also I have seen the most reviews of this product on YouTube, and you can see people praising Benq for creating such a nice product.
The only drawback that I could notice was ghosting effect if you've kept the picture mode to be dynamic, but the product is well priced, and you cannot expect much from a 60hz IPS panel.
If you're going from a 16 inch to a 24 inch, you will not regret it. Peace!",5
10915,323,"It's extremely well built with very sturdy stands and frames.

The picture is optimised to go easy on the eyes than looking good. It's great for office use, reading etc, but not good for any multimedia usage. The black levels are not very black. It feels more red due to the always on blue light filter.
Not very good for gaming too due to a little washed out colors and average response time.

Antiglare is great, it very good for reading especially when using windows greyscale.",4

10919,327," This monitor has been good for 3 years which I bought at 11512 INR. It suddenly started flickering after 39 months 2 days for which I could not avail warranty (the warranty is for 39 months). I contacted Benq service center and they were very prompt in addressing the issue. But, they confirmed it a problem of the panel which is very costly to replace (costs close to the monitor itself). Also, the replaced panel has a warranty for 3 months only. So, repairing is not at all worthy. They provided no extended warranty for 2 days or any other adjustment. So, I have to buy a new monitor ( I am done with Benq). The manufacturer precisely calculated the average lifespan and set the warranty period. For a longer lifespan and durability, choose LG or Dell. It is not value-for-money for the long run. I gave 2 stars for the 3 years working.",2
10920,328,"**Update*
After 2 months of use. got vignette effect on screen. Waiting for Benq Service center to fix it :(

1. 27inch FHD IPS display is great to have for work.
2. The Vertical monitor setup by rotating the monitor is also a good addition, I wish the screen rotates/changes from portrait to landscape automatically instead of setting the display settings on macbook pro.
3. Swivel on 24 inch monitor rotates the neck of the monitor where as on 27 inch the neck doesn't rotate on swivel the monitor base has a movable pad so the entire monitor can be moved but not similar to the GW2480T (24 inch model)
4. Cable management is good, I like the thoughtful ness went into the monitor handle on back, very handy one if you want to move monitor.
5. Brighness intelligence with EyeCare features are great additions.",5

10924,332,"I bought the product primarily for work. It‚Äôs definitely very useful and a great buy, but a 22‚Äù monitor may be slightly more comfortable. That said, the text is clear and the connection with my Mac is seamless and took all of two minutes to set up, so it‚Äôs still been a very positive experience. The reviews about the speakers are accurate though - very low sound, even at max volume. Not too great if you don‚Äôt have separate speakers and wanted this to double as a Netflix watching screen.",4

This is a nice monitor in this price range.

Review after 15 days:
Reducing the stars for faulty item and replacement guy behavior and handling of the new/replacement item.
Monitor had a flicker issue and white border after use of 5 days.

Best Part:
Thanks a lot to Amazon team (5 star) for handling this case gracefully and refunding the money.
First time delivery and return pickup guys were co operative and did assisted well and shown compassion to the customer. Top of all Customer care executive took the note of what went well and what could have been improved.

Worst Part:
The delivery guy who came for replacement of the item was rude and his boss asked questions over phone what is the fault and all which was not expected. The delivery guys who came for replacement was rude and did not handled old and new package carefully and Rejected the replacement by saying the serial number is not present.

Audio out with sony headphones is studio like .

As for screen size ....it is breathtaking ...no 4k led tv can even come close to it .

Thank you amazon from an old customer",5
10927,335,"Monitor arrived with a 16 amp plug. I'm not sure why since absolutely no computer peripheral I'm familiar with needs that kind of wattage. It makes me wonder if the team even knows whom they are making these monitors for or if they've actually used any of their own products. I would hope that this is some scam to make you buy the 5 amp cable separately. If it's not a scam, I'd have to assume they're incompetent at a very fundamental level.",3
10928,336,"Very good quality product, excellent performance.

This can not be used as TV because of two reasons. The first reason is inbuilt speakers are not of good quality and level is also quite low. The second reason is it is a monitor so it does come with a remote to change input source from HDMI1 to HDM2 or to VGA, so, you need to change the input source by clicking on buttons below the monitor.",4
10930,338,Good product.,5
10931,339,"This screen deserves a purchase because:
- It's well built - buttons feel clicky, low wobble while moving around
- The stand is ergonomic and functional, providing great support.
- Cable management is smart. Compared to LG or Samsung, this helps my desk stay neater. Don't know why other products costing much more can't do a decent design for cable management.
- Has inbuilt functionality to dim or increase brightness depending on ambient light.
- DPI is sufficient. Im using as a secondary to a macbook, and it does not feel inadequate. My 24"" LG with maxx audio at work has poorer resolution.",4

It has an ips type, at 60 hz, but you might be attracted to the 75hz monitor at similar price but go for this, as having an nvidia gpu, i was able to easily overclock this to 75hz and it did not heat in my stress test so if you want to do gaming, then still go for this as it has a ips type not a tn or a va type",5

Your system should be capable of playing high definition videos. Monitor is very good. There is one cons: stand is fixed, you can tilt monitor up or down , but the stand will not go up or down.

10945,353,"Amazing quality product delivered at this cost backed up with super Amazon delivery....what went well....
1. The pricing.
2. Multi inputs to include HDMI, VGA and even audio in.
3. Built in speakers that dont clutter the desk.
4. Screen size...maxx screen availabilitywith smallest bezels at this pricepoint
5. Beats my HP 22es monitor hands down with amazing quality, sharpness and eye control tech.
6. Wall mountable..
7. Wire organiser design that handles wire outlet so neatly.

Cons

1. No wallmount provided.
2. Not so slim in looks, but the same is not noticeable at all.
3. No separate audio cables or HD cables provided, has only VGA and power chord supplied with the package.

Overall a great affordable product with features akin to a high end LED monitor that easily cost 15K or more.",5
10946,354,"Ideal for Work-from-home environment. Anti-glare works wonders for extended sessions. Of-course, it is always recommended to take a break for a minute after 30 minutes of staring at the monitor.

Gaming experience has been pleasant. The stock 60Hz can be overclocked to 74Hz-75Hz if desired but to someone that plays single player games exclusively , high refresh rates are a waste of money IMO.

Very wide viewing angles. Colour accuracy is okay but good enough for most tasks for the average user. My work doesn't involve any video/photo-edition so there are zero complaints. Extremely demanding users need to consider other options and also shell out more money.

Monitor prop stand is durable and sturdy with very little wobble.

TL;DR Value for money product.",5

Pros
1. Ideal size for doing office work. Eye care feature with low blue light (reading mode) is a plus.
2. The main feature is the height adjustable stand. Helps in getting the most ergonomic position thereby avoiding neck pain.
Cons
1. Speaker is very weak. Laptop speaker is better.
2. Headset port is for speaker/listening only. The port cannot be used for mic feature of the headset. So I still need to attach my headset to laptop.",4

- Sound is terrible.
- It grabs the control from Mac - you cant control sound from the mac. You have to use the clumsy buttons on the monitor. At least they should have left that there.
- The supplied power plug is 15 Amp size (India). Does not fit in any spike guards/extension boards.

About monitor performance?

Pointless to talk about performance when the monitor cannot even power on..

Manufacturer should provide correct cables as accessories.

Not good for movie as the refreshing rate is too slow, not able to show fast motion. For office purpose, the clarity is not there",2

Pros
Good display with Antiglare screen.
Eye care option to reduce Blue Like (Some may not like that option).
The Stand equipped is easy to install and does not attach scratches.
The speakers are addons, though not powerful.
Liked the cable management enabled in the stand.

Cons
Power cable provided in 16Amps which does not fit most sockets. 16Amp cable to required for an LCD monitor. Had to replace it with a smaller one to connect to UPS.",4

No doubt quality is best in itself. Got the delivery, next day after the order placed.

Well packed and safe. I would like to say 24"" inch is the best for monitor & PS4 playing purpose.

27"" wont be balanced one while you have very less distance between you and screen during monitor work with laptop/desktop/playstation.

24"""" inch is the recommended size.

It also has a tilt featuer (up and down) which is convenient to use.

The speakers are below average, but at this price its great to have them to simply watch you tube videos or normal windows sound.

I compared it with HP screens , and found that at the same price (or less) BenQ was having speakers as well.

First of all, it looks absolutely gorgeous ;-) you can call it a centerpiece of your desk. I'm in love with the slim bezels. The overall experience is extremely immersive.
The display is pretty awesome, color reproduction is quite accurate. Wouldn't recommend it for the color critical work though!
Just play around with the menu options, slight tweaks in settings will give you the best possible picture. I'm impressed with the sharpness and black levels. No visible light bleeds.
Response times are quite mediocre on all IPS panels so won't blame the product. Casual gaming would be fine but this is not meant for heavy gamers.
Auto brightness feature is quite gimmicky and buggy so please don't expect much. I'd prefer not to say anything about the speakers (just grab a pair of headphones or use dedicated speakers ;-))
All in all it's a great product to have at this price point. You won't have any regrets if you buy this with right expectations. NOT recommended for people who want to buy Lamborghini at Alto's price... Peace :)",4
10962,370,"-Good connectivity options
-Great looks n build in price
-Nice thin bezel
-Great for general extended use (work, surfing etc.)
-Easy to assemble
-Not height adjustable with default stand, should be fine, you can buy other custom stands as required
-Not for hard core gamers at given resolution n frame rate, but that is expected at this price point. Should be very sufficient of you are casual gamer and on budget
-Various display modes n settings available, handy for switching between work mode n multimedia
-Inbuilt speakers are just bad, don't consider them to be there n just ignore.

There are many Pros and Cons comparisons available, so I am not adding one more.
But just to let you know that the Audio output is too low, as its a Monitor and not a TV.
The cable which comes along is HDMI to HDMI and I needed HDMI to DisplayPort so I have to struggle a bit find out an alternative, and I end up finding an old VGA cable but looking for HDMI to DisplayPort for Audio playback via Monitor.
I had another laptop that has HDMI port, so I tested with it for the Audio output but sometimes I was able to play Audio from the Monitor and most of the time it plays from the laptop only. Unable to figure out is it a bug or I am missing anything.",5

Never make the mistake to order 1080p 27"" display if your using it as an office monitor or ms word and Excel related work. Yes for watching videos and it may be sufficient. Also 60 hz screen refreshment rate is also not compelling. I mainly use this monitor to watch videos and do some chart analysis and this monitor does the job.

Moreover, Before buying I was concerned about the warranty as Amazon says that it would be 39 months from the manufacturing date or 36 months from the date of purchase whichever is closest so I was concerned that what if I would get a model that was manufactured way earlier than 2019 as the first availablity of this monitor is in 2017 but my model has a manufacturing date of MAR 2019. If I talk about the display, it is good and the built quality is top-notch. The only con of this monitor are the speakers, they are decent.

We have many features where we can adjust screen according to our work.

The power circuit got bust and the monitor was not powering on. It took 25 days for the service team to replace it. Pathetic service even in a metro city.

The circuit components must have been of low quality.

Old review:
GW2480 24-inch - Got it for just below INR 10K.
Overall it is just an average to good monitor for day-to-day usage. But nothing impressive.
Pros:
* All the usual functions work as expected
* Picture quality is good but one needs to set the brightness very high to get better picture quality.
* Although the bezels are thin, it looks sturdy.
* HDMI cable included in the pack. So, no need to buy that separately (like few other monitors in the market)
* Wall mounting
* Several preset picture modes
* Price-INR 10K
Cons:
* Slight darkening of the panel on both vertical sides near the edges when viewed exactly from middle on low brightness (around 40% or less). This is kind of typical LCD drawback of old days but didn't expect it from BenQ brand. That too in 2021. But this goes away for higher brightness is set (of course, that will strain the eyes)
* Although there are several preset picture modes with respective brightness/contrast with bright display, most of the pre-defined ones are too bright for daily usage and one can't adjust the brightness and some other settings for these pre-defined modes.

Felt that my 10 year old Dell All-in-one 2310 had better display overall (although bit enhanced colour & colour/contrast calibration wasn't possible with it).

I was bit skeptical before buying and that skepticism was very valid I guess. As these companies churn out these monitors with less than INR 10K, I guess they are cutting some corners.",1
10993,401,"Excellent picture quality but the sound produced by in-built speakers are very horrible and useless. Even in full volume its sound cannot be heard from 5-6 feet distance. Look is very smart, good anti-glare screen. Overall, it is a good monitor if you don't use its audio.",4

Inbuilt speakers are good enough. Like other commented, I did not expect a home theatre like speakers from a monitor. Its suitable for hearing computer sounds and attending meetings with client.

10997,405,"This monitor is amazing. The color is just perfect. Many reviews said about the low brightness of the monitor. But I think its highest brightness setting is enough if you don't want your eyes to pop out of pain.
Gaming performance is 8/10. I played GTA V and Forza Horizon 4 on my Xbox on this monitor. Picture quality was just amazing. There was hardly any loss of frame rates. But if you are hardcore passionate gamer then go for higher refresh rate models.
The speakers are ok. If you are in a very quite room its ok to listen songs. Even a fan can disrupt the sound badly.
The four edges shows a very light black tint but it isn't visible when I look from another angle. So I guess its not a malfunction. The bezel could have been thinner though.
Build quality is solid too.

The screen display is awesome and refresh rate also amazing.

I am giving this review after 4 weeks of using this and this will be long lasting product.
Thank you Benq and Amazon for safe delivery as well.",5

11002,410,About this monitor everything is good but if it comes on the in-built speaker it doesn't performs so well but if i talk about its worthiness at this price then this monitor is really very excellent.,4
11003,411,"Pretty good for office works. Enough brightness as needed and less strain to eyes for sure. Not tested much for gaming or watching videos. Will update my review once it's tested.

What I feel can be improved:

1) The innovative screw at the bottom to fix the stand. It doesn't fit properly at one go, but had to try multiple times to fit in.
2) The on-screen OSD menu of the monitor looks oldish. Hoping we can get get an firmware update to the monitor that has a new redesigned OSD menu.",4
11004,412,"I am more than happy with the product and its delivery. Have been using it for 1 day now and I am more than happy and I just wish and pray that this continues.

Pros:
1. Value for money
2. Amazing clarity
3. Superb and sleek design

Cons:
1. No USB Port (Can live with it though, if you get a USB hub :))
2. Audio output is pathetic (Please ignore it and get an external speaker)",4
11005,413,"I purchased this for my WFH purpose actually it's does job well... no lag than while connecting. there seems to be an single pixel failure when trun on but it disaprears upon using it.

I was expected good audio but audio is not up to the mark",4
11006,414,"This is review after 14 days of usage (9-10 hours/day). I used this monitor for working from home. Also used it for casual gaming (medal of honor, Call of duty kind of games), Web-surfing and watching you-tube videos and movies.
Good points: Easy installation, HDMI cable received with the monitor, bezel less design gives a premium feel, brightness intelligence feature is good, eye strain is very less. color production is good.
Bad points: haven't really found any.

Overall a good buy!",4
11007,415,Very Good,4
11008,416,"I needed to get an external monitor because my laptop screen seemed a bit small for me. This monitor is pretty big and the price wasn't bad at all. It has multiple modes you can use (multimedia mode, reading mode, office mode, etc). Each mode can be used for a different type of purpose.

I dont like my screen to be too bright so I use the reading mode, which adds some yellow to the screen. It's very soft on my eyes.

For gaming, it's amazing! The colors are really vibrant and there's no pixelisation. I would definitely recommend this.",5
11009,417,"Monitor is good for office and home use. Has good viewing angles, the sensor for autobrightness works fine. This monitor is good for coding and general use like surfing or browsing internet, working on documents. The inbuild sound speakers that comes with monitor are not suitable for music or movies and can serve the purpose of notifications sounds or silent music with not bass. Monitor stand is stif and good. Overall a good monitor after a use of one month. Not good for professional gamers.",4
11010,418,"It comes with a power cable plug which will not fit in easily with extension cords and wall sockets. You have to struggle alot.

Please avoid purchasing the product",1
11011,419,This does the job absolutely flawlessly. I use it for work from home purpose and the screen clarity is awesome. Very soothing to the eyes. Although don‚Äôt go by the speaker feature mentioned as it‚Äôs only for name sake. You can hardly hear anything from these speakers. But that is secondary as it‚Äôs excellent in it‚Äôs primary purpose.,5
11012,420,Good monitor. Option of reading light setting is good and ease to eyes,5
11013,421,"This monitor is a very good one.
I have just unboxed the item. (The same day I am writing)
All the features are good.

But only 1 disadvantage:- it's 3 pin power adapter is too large to fit in a standard socket. 15 Ampere plug is needed. (Probably its power requirement is large in comparison to other standard computer monitor).

Possibly it can never be powered from any ups directly. (Another extension chord is needed.)
So, in case of power failure computer can not be used (even for few minutes).
This feedback will be edited later on. (Possibly after couple of years).",5
11014,422,"The quality of panel is way better than i thought and the colour production id very even and good. the only thing was the refresh rate is low which is not recommended for gamers. But for general usage, office work and movie watching it was a good choice. please see other reviews before purchase",4
11015,423,Best qualitu best picture,5
11016,424,"While the monitor and other information met expectation, giving a heavy-duty three-pin plug that's suitable for heavy duty machines does not help the customer. Customers have to procure a three pin plug that goes into standard socket.",4
11017,425,"If you're looking for a monitor for programming/content consumption, this is highly recommended. I don't game at all so can't comment on the gaming experience.
The stand is sturdy and all types of adjustments are supported. The speakers are just a gimmick, they are just there and can be used only in case of an emergency. Picture quality and the brightness level is as expected. There were no IPS glow/ screen bleeding in my unit but you're advised to check for it as soon as your monitor arrives.

If you're planning to buy GW2480, I'd suggest investing some more money in this model, as the stand that this comes with comes very handy.",5
11018,426,"Works well, speaker quite useless, I wonder why they bothered to put that in.
I'm satisfied with it, though my use is really as an extra screen to put on when having an internal presentation in our office, so not very critical.",4
11019,427,"Overall fantastic purchase.
Clarity is really good.
Speakers are also of decent quality. Although voice does not go that high but according to speaker size it is good.
Viewing angles are good.
No issue so far. No screen bleeding nothing. I bought dell ips as well but it was bleeding so I returned. This is far better than dell. Eye care technology is a great add on in this monitor. Go for it !!",4
11020,428,Satisfied,4
11021,429,Very happy with the product. Inordered this as working from home is now new jormal. I had shoulder paun and continuously looking down at the computer screen was increasing my shoulder and neck pain. With this screen i now now have to look straight in the screen. This does not strain my eyes. The hdmi cable is also in the box so the i stallation was super quick no extra purchases. And as usual amazon delivery was superbüëçüèª,4
11022,430,I‚Äôve been using this monitor for more than 2 years now. And I must say its a very nice monitor for all kinds of usage. I mainly run graphic design softwares like adobe photoshop and illustrator and this monitor produces very good colours which are important in my work. Full HD videos and Gaming grapgic is also very nice. At this price this monitor is steal. I‚Äôm pretty happy with my purchase!,4
11023,431,"Excellent monitor. I've been using this product for about 1 month, and i must say its awesome. Installation of this product is super easy, even a small child can do it (if he has some common sense). Picture quality is average - but anti-glare is awesome ! (hardly has any glare). Bonus point for this monitor is that it has various modes such as office mode, multimedia mode, reading mode(which gives least strain to the eyes). So its a very feature-ful monitor with auto-brightness sensor (which works well) and also low blue light mode for very long duration of usage. Basically i am very happy with this purchase, probably can't get better than this at this price.",5
11024,432,"The monitor comes with a 16 Amp power cable which is practically useless since we rarely have a 16 Amp socket in our rooms for that matter. However, you can use a 6 Amp power cord but then you have to spend another 300 bucks, so order it in advance if you don't want to wait!

Disappointed from Amazon to let it's customers go via this hassle and let BenQ do this on their platform.

My overall rating is for my experience and not about the product which on the contrary is a good buy owing to BenQ's reputation.",3
11025,433,"Made a mistake of buying this for coding, but the issue is the pixel density is <163PPI, and that makes the text a bit blurrish. Discovered this very late after changing HDML cables and DP cables and playing around with scaling options etc...

Definitely not for Mac.

One thing that can help is keep the display mirroring ""on"" and used scaled display to make text sharper (because a scaled down picture reduces the screen area).",2
11026,434,"Monitors stand is not adjustable, it is fixed so hight adjustment is an issue with this display.",4
11027,435,"Pros:
1. Speakers (Hardly any others have)
2. HDMI ports 2 (No other in this price segment)
3. A good screen and sturdy stand
4. Auto brightness adjustment sensor

Cons:
1. Useless VGA cable (after 2019 which laptop comes with VGA port??) HDMI cable is must.
I tried using type-c to VGA adaptor, monitor works but speakers do not work.
2. Not so great speakers (don't think of using it as TV)
3. Backlight bleed all over (typical IPS)
4. HDMI ports are very near, cannot put a cable and fireStick together (2 cables will work easily)

It could have been really handy if it had USB ports, but no !

I bought this on sale, costed me Rs. 6750, worth the money, I am going to keep this despite of cons but due to the pros. I would recommend buying if you are ok with these cons.",3
11028,436,"Very good monitor for the price. Does not strain the eye and size is apt.
Not for coders who may want to use it vertically and also because the text is not amazingly sharp (4/5).

This is the second BenQ in our office and so far no complaints about reliability whatsoever.",4
11029,437,"I like the monitor for the following cases.
1. The Monitor has 2 HDMI inputs. So can you the same monitor for gaming (PS4) and office work (secondary monitor) without plugging and unplugging wires.
2. The monitor has a Audio line in and Audio line out (3.5mm socket). Now i can connect the speakers directly to the monitor instead of connecting to every device I use the monitor with.
3. Bazel less look is amazing.
4. The monitor also has inbuilt speakers which can be useful in quiet rooms.
5. Wide angle viewing.",5

Delivery was before time - Thanks a lot Amazon for this.
A 24"" monitor within the budget. Has modes for multimedia, web Surfing, Office and Reading and each mode controls the brightness for the purpose. Has good blue light filter and pretty sooting for eyes.
Has built in speakers, but don't expect high quality output. It's a very basic speaker. This device has a 3.5mm monitor jack as well.
There is some provision for angle adjustment.. But no height adjustment available. Would need to depend on monitor stands or using bulky books for height adjustment :)
Am not a gaming person.. Not sure of performance during games
Very happy with the purchase",5

11038,446,"I am writing this review after 5 months of use.
In absolute terms (cannot compare with others), the monitor is very good.
For general media consumption the picture quality is awesome. (I am not a content creator and cannot say anything in the regard)
It is fairly light and compact (bezel less from three sides).
It has an all the necessary ports; aux, HDMI and external speakers.
Brightness is good and you can comfortably view things even in a well lit room.
The menu functions are easy to access, although the ambient sensor doesn't look calibrated and doesn't work properly. I use it in fixed brightness mode only.
Speakers are awful. I would definitely recommend buying a non speaker version and save some money. Maybe invest in decent external speakers.

Quality issues- A pixel went dead recently.Although it is very small and hardly visible, I hope overtime it doesn't affect nearby pixels or ""grow"".

A note on size:
I bought a 27"" monitor with thinking that bigger is better. However, your field of view depends on the desk size (etc). Emperically, buy a 27"" monitor only when your desk size > 2 feet. Otherwise in some cases, like while playing games, you won't be able to full screen.",5

You can open many windows and work at same time. I am doing my freelance job easily now. Also I am playing game on this monitor. If you are not a e-Sports guy (who plays competitive game tournaments) then go for it. It has wall mount option so if your table shorts like me you can hang it on wall.

Edit: Been using it for few months now. Works flawlessly. Speakers suck a bit. But anyway who buys monitors for speaker quality?",4

The anti glare technology works so amazing and that's a plus point while I edit my pictures in a bright lit room with no reflection. The colour quality (RGB) is also perfect and the viewing angles are great what else do you need in a monitor at this price. I haven't tried my hands in gaming but would definitely like to try it. But for now I am totally satisfied with the product.,5

The refresh rate is 5ms which may be a problem for some gamers. But until you are doing coding or movie or binge watch the refresh rate will never ever bug you. It is just visible when reading a running text ( who does read a running text ?

However I was shocked when the second product I received has the same issue in the same spot.

Somehow this issue is not present in the logo/loading screen. It is also barely noticeable in dark movies while too much happening on the screen. But is definitely an issue in white scenes or softwares.

I have attached picture of this issue. This issue is more prominent when you you put the brightness less than 40 or so.

Below is the detailed review of this product:

Pros:
> Nice bezels
> Cable management system
> Build quality feels durable
> white to black separation is good
> Colour looks ok after some tweaking

Cons:
> Brightness uniformity is a big issue. Some part of the screen looks dull or darker than others.
> Black is not pure black but grey like
> There is some back light bleed issue in dark environment but ok as per the price point
> Brightness is too high even for 0 settings. Not at all suitable for working in a dark environment.

Final thoughts:
If you are going to work on creative apps like Photoshop or some other editing softwares then please don't buy it. For watching movies and other entertainment purpose it is ok.

On every white screen like Google Chrome or Microsoft office softwares you will notice the dark area on the screen due to the brightness uniformity issue.",2

Colour grade are vibrant and smooth which doesn't result in eye pain if you sit in front of it for more than 5-6 hours in a day !
Not suitable for gamers they would require higher refresher rate which it doesn't has but if your main purpose is not gaming just buy it wont be disappointed at all !",5
11064,472,"It does not give much stress to eye, blue light sensor and filter works good,Brightness sensor adjust screen brightness as light intencity changes. One cons_ u can see very thin lines like finger prints on screen in videos or pics. This can be improved.",3

For the price , its the best monitor to start your video/ photo/entertainment journey.
Colours are really good and accurate, its and ips screen.
Do note the monitor isn't build for gaming, it can play games with good colors but will have some screen-tearing .

The only minor cons i have is :
Doesn't include hdmi cable from the box.
Brightness isn't sufficient if you are going to use it on well lit rooms or near windows.",5

The autobrightness setting on this is a 5/5 and I am super thankful for it as I also use this using dim lights in my room.
Overall its a quality product and colours and contrast and overall viewing angles are the way you'd want. I specificaly use it for work and watching movies so I couldn't have asked for more!

The brightness sensors work really well and I'm impressed with the price tag amazon offers (bought it for 12.4k).
If you are looking for something for daily use (non-gamers) like for work or watching movies, this is the best out there.",5
11074,482,"One of the best monitors I've worked on.
Screen Size is just Perfect..
No Bezels at all and trust me this makes the experience so much better
Brightness level is perfect. It has some very good presets that you can try and use according to your use.
The sensor is also good but I would rather use the presets.
Sound is low and I wouldn't watch any movie with that sound. But yes its a good thing to have just in case your speakers fail.
No Pixel bleeding at all.. even in night use no strain on the eyes.
I would 100% recommend this product.
Its VALUE FOR MONEY.",5
11075,483,"At this price this monitor is worthy. One thing i want to say that it an LCD IPS display, which they kind of manipulating it by saying LED Backlight. Viewing angels are good . Bezels are thin noticeably thin i expected this from it. Picture quality is good , as it is LCD display colours are more accurate. After all most of pro level indestrial used displays also LCD and at 10000 rs its value for money.
This i am writing after few months of use of this monitor and only problem i am facing is excessive backlight bleed . When you use this monitor with a black background sometimes it shows noticable backlight bleed but not every time if you use monitor not for long hours and less frequently then it will not be such a big issue but if you want to buy for extensive long hours of use then this might be a problem for few. Other then that everything works perfect . Ambient light sensor and other functions all are fine.",5

The anti glare option also good, good to buy.",4

The sound of the built-in speakers is low (as expected), The screen quality is great for my work (I'm not a gamer, so I cannot review that aspect). The menu options are easy to use and there are some useful settings that can be adjusted. The bezel is thin so it looks great and the plastic quality is great too.",5

i work in Photoshop, aftereffects and other creative software's this monitor won't be a good option for us as we need to see the true srgb and black values
i edited a images for a client with this monitor then when i saw it in my laptop it looked so different the brightness/ contrast were totally all over the place i had to redo the whole thing.
so i returned it back to amazon

hope it'll help fellow graphic designers and content creators to make a decision",3
11082,490,"UPDATE:
the monitor actually has a good firmware, you can customize 2 buttons the way you want it! haven't seen such feature anywhere, stupid marketing team should have highlighted it!
Now I can turn up and down brightness and change picture modes as I want it!

STILL NOT 4 STAR ABOVE SINCE IT HAS FLICKER ISSUES SOMETIMES

1st impressions as below, update above.
The product is marketed for its eyecare technology which they do by providing a blue light filter shortcut. but the most annoying thing is you cannot switch between different picture modes without this blue light filtering. and the worst part is you cannot turnoff the filter by clicking the same button instead you will have to go to the settings and navigate through a maze of options and change back to normal mode!",3
11083,491,"After a weeks usage I'm writing this review. This monitor is good at this price range. I use this primarily for writing code and satisfies my requirement. Picture quality is good and of course not a bad option for watching movies while taking a break.
Coming to the anti-glare property it's on the top notch and won't give too much strain for your eyes.",4
11084,492,"It is a very good product for the price range of 9K. The adjustable warmth and light sensor makes it conducive for any ambient environments. Viewing angle is pretty good. Exterior finish is premium matte makes it look cozy. I have tried connecting with my set top box and the picture quality is awesome than my TV. Sound quality is not so bad with the inbuilt speakers. Overall I would rate 5 as it does a good job for the price range.

The only thing I feel on the negative side is that the height adjustment. This monitor leg supports only tilt angle.",5
11085,493,I bought this monitor to have as my second monitor. It works fine as expected without any issues. Only problem I faced was that the monitor power adapter comes with the big plug size which is used for AC's and such. Had to order another normal sized power cable because of that.,4
11086,494,"I purchased this monitor in February. And today it gave up. I use to use this monitor as my main monitor for my day trading purpose and it was working fine till today and few minutes ago it just turned off on its own and when I turned it on the left bottom corner went black and gradually the entire left side went back within few seconds.

I have registered a complain to BenQ, There technician will come and see what could be done.

The technician asked me to send him the photograph of the damaged monitor and after seeing the photograph he refused to come and said the warranty cannot be claimed as it has formed a bubble which is not covered in the warranty. Upon asking how did the bubble formed he said it might have happened due to some pressure applied on the screen.... Really it was an pathetic experience with benq after sales services.",1
11087,495,"The product quality is outstanding. However, I was puzzled when I noticed the power supply wire had a 16 amp socket.
6 amps is sufficient for this purpose. Otherwise, a 16 amp socket will be required.",5
11088,496,"# The picture quality and color reproduction is good. I tried playing 4k UHD video (btw, this is a full HD monitor)
# The brightness options offered are good.
# Buttons for control are convenient.
# The cable hiding is nice.
# HDMI cable is supplied in box.
# The assembly is easy.
# The base is Matt finish and anti skid.
# Speakers are good and loud enough when used at 100%
# Some tilt adjustment is there.
# screen is non-glossy.

3. Within a second the screen visibility get adjusted to the surrounding light and your eyes hardly notice it, really Excellent.

The built quality is very very good compared to my another 22inch led dell monitor which you can see back of this monitor image. It is quiet heavy too. Speakers are normal, not loud.
It is good for students. Not so good for designers, small text editors and photoshop editors.

So guys please decide if you want to upgrade to 27 inch, think of at least 2k resolution.

Thanks for reading.
Hope it helps you to buy what you want,,,

Haven't had any display problems for the past month since I've purchased this monitor.

Monitor is good, but if you are audio required then look for another monitor, since audio is not really good, otherwise in this price monitor is good, we got damaged audio speakers, but after follow-up with service team for our audio, they given us new monitor, service is good.

If u like movies and want to watch 1080p videos on YouTube this is best. I am amazed that I spent 6000 rs almost twice a year buying bad monitors but this is best monitor with real life feeling of videos. Buy it u won't regret it.

Although the auto brightness works in different way than I expected, it does it's job. I don't really use though. I imagined it to be something like phone's auto-brightness. It only changes contrast, and a little bit of brightness.

It‚Äôs got speakers , so good for Town Hall meetings / Webinar‚Äôs ( outputs not crazy loud, but it‚Äôs good if you have a quiet room )
It can be tilted , so that‚Äôs surely a good thing.
And lastly it‚Äôs got a matt style screen - so no reflections or glare .

Just one word of advice - this isn‚Äôt going to wow you , so I‚Äôd say office work or for students. Don‚Äôt think this is best suited for gaming .",5
11158,566,"Good product, performance is excellent and exceptional difference or upgrade in my viewing experience. Suggest the product to buy if anyone is thinking to buy one in budget, though I still have a doubt whether it is an LED or LCD as I received a manual saying LCD in the packet.

I wish to buy one more if I get a clarity on this LCT/LED thing ..",5

Cons:
- Audio quality is bad",5

The edge display just makes it one of best way to watch 16:9 video content and the auto brightness adjustment keeps too much glare in the night. With a choice of Serial, Hdmi & Display port it does cover atleatlst 3 devices for connectivity.",5
11163,571,"Very useful product. I like two HDMI ports, one I use to connect Amazon Fire TV or Google Chromecast while other one I use to connect with my laptop to use two screens. I connect my CPU in VGA port. Two 3.5 mm jacks in the monitor are also useful, I just connect external speaker with monitor to watch programs and movies using Fire TV or Google Chromecast without using CPU. The internal speaker inside the monitor is of no use because not much sound from it.",5

Only limitation is not able to tilt the monitor. I was height adjustment is not available but nothing mentioned about tilting too. Deducting one star for that.",4

I was using similar Product in my office that's why I ordered this one as it has great colors and a good picture quality. Lookwise it is a great product .

If you are planning to buy ""JUST GO FOR IT"".",5

Display quality is overall good, build is solid and you can work for a longer time like 10-12 hours easily without stressing out your eyes, sound quality is poor and one more concern is they do not provide HDMI cable instead they provide VGA. Overall if you are only looking for a monitor in less than 8K price range. this is the one.!",5

- Soft on eye and comfortable for long use
- Low Blue light tech makes it really smooth for eyes
- Super slim bezels make the viewing experience amazing
- great gaming experience
- worth every single penny",5
11172,580,I saved Rs.1000/month for 8 months and got this monitor. And within a year automatically screen started to popuing up and after sales service says it's because of dust and the main thing is that they didn't even send someone at the spot to visit the product. I used to be a L4 level mobile repair engineer and I can say this with guaranty this isn't because of dust.,1

Cons is screen bleeding like other already send in review but you won't notice in normal use overall its a good monitor",5
11174,582,"Monitor much more than I imagined.. I have been using, HP, LG monitors earlier but after using this BenQ for close to 3 months i found its really good. Its Easy to use, awesome picture quality , modes to adjust along with features like anti glare..

Few minor tweks can be taken care here, Inbuilt speakers audio is bit lower, quality of power cable, this could have been better.. Still giving 5 star because of the price point and sleeky design.",5
11175,583,"The monitor is really good. The picture quality was awesome, but the sound is really bad. You can barely listen to it but, most people use speakers so it should not be a problem. Besides that it is the best you can get in this price.",4
11176,584,One star less since having a inbuilt webcam and mic would have made this a perfect VOIP monitor,4

I complained about this and got the whole package replaced.
I am very much satisfied with my purchase.
The bezel less display is amazing.
The brightness modes for media, websurfing, reading make the perfect t

The speakers are not very effective..so you will require external speakers for movies.

I can not comment on gaming but I guess go for a higher refresh rate monitor for that.

Blue light filter is very good and no ficker I have observed so far.

HDMI cable does not come with 22 inch one but you can get it from amazon additionally.",5
11183,591,This monitor produces excellent colors with good brightness and contrast. The eye protection is very good for night-time working. I think they should've removed the speaker from the monitor completely to reduce the cost because the speaker volume is too low. Even my headphones produce a louder sounds.,4

I would 100% recommend it .",5

""BenQ ships this monitor with a LARGE 16A power plug which needs an AEH point. In India, such power outlets are only provided for Refrigerators, Owens, Geysers and similar electrical equipments that need high Amperes. A monitor does not need 16A. Why is BenQ shipping it with an unusually big power socket forcing customers to buy additional converters? Can BenQ or Amazon answer this question?""

I called Amazon customer service to return this item, but they say it's the manufacturer's issue, not Amazon's. Hence can't accept returns. First of all, nowhere does it say in the product description that this monitor requires a 16A power outlet. Unsuspecting customers purchase it and get stuck with it.

PLEASE DO NOT buy anything from Amazon India.",1

It's having the best aspect Ratio. Quality is also good. Colors are nice. Best experience for design, gaming, movies etc. Inbuilt speaker is not good.

Pros:
No bleed
Decent configuration considering the competitive price
Compact Size
VESA Wall Mount
No flickering

In built speakers are of no use. They could have removed them from monitor.
Monitor goes in sleep mode after a couple of minutes while working on MAC. This is not seen in Microsoft Windows.",5

Please note that it has 5ms response time and it is a LCD monitor.

More than happy with the purchase.",5

The Monitor is good enough for office jobs. With whatever setting I tried, I could not get pleasing picture quality from this. it is a full HD screen and connects over HDMI. I am not sure whether my tastes are spoiled by using iMac for over a decade! This monitor has built-in speakers, but not useful at all. However audio out provision is there which is good. There is a cable management provision, which is a nice thing to have.
Overall, I can rate only 3/5, though this is sufficient for office work.",3
11214,622,"I have been using it for last one week and it has all the features mentioned in the description. it is Flickr free it has auto brightness. It is the best monitor if you have to spend a lot of time in front of your system. It has less blue light compared to other monitors once you go into reading mode it completely gets rid of blue light.

Now coming to speakers, They are basic, you can just listen to the audio, they‚Äôre not meant for listening to music. They are loud enough if you are in a closed environment.

I don‚Äôt know about gaming experience because I don‚Äôt play graphic intensive games.

One more observation, auto brightness don‚Äôt go too low when there is no light around and you can‚Äôt decrease it manually when it‚Äôs in auto-brightness mode, that‚Äôs a bit annoying.

Overall it‚Äôs a bang for buck.",5

Update: I've returned the monitor, as the second monitor was worse than first, and one thing I noticed in both of them is my eyes were getting strained after little use, as text was not that much sharper. If you want you can go for a 24 or 22-inch variant in this monitor as the FHD resolution is not enough for 27-inch screen.",3
11246,654,"This monitor is really good at this price point ( I got it for 9499 during amazon sale )
Pros:
1.Colors are much more Vibrant then normal LED's, i have a triple monitor Setup so i can compare this with other LED's
from dell.
2.Dark and Bright values are much better differentiated.
3.The best one is the price you cant get any thing better than this at this price Point...Kudos to Benq for that
4. Brightness is way too much high
5. Multiple connecting options ( i plugged it to my PC as well as my PS4)

Cons
1. There is some back light bleeding ( But that is ok even expensive monitors has minor light bleeds)

At this price point i think Benq has done a great job.
if you want a cheap IPS display then this monitor is for you.",5
11247,655,"Overall the monitor is great but there're a couple of issues I would like to point out.

Being an IPS panel, this monitor suffers from back light glow. Blacks are not fully black. This is not noticeable if one is working in well lit environment. However, in a dark environment at night it does cause eye strain.

The buttons on the monitor are physical push buttons. It would have been great if they were touch buttons. Physical buttons tend to get defective over a period of time.",4
11248,656,The sound could be a little bit better. Otherwise it is great.,4
11249,657,"This is great for the price, I got it for 7,750 INR. The picture quality is great, I had to set rgb to full on ps4 to make the colors right. The inbuilt speakers are terrible, worse than smartphone speakers. The bezeless design is great and it looks even better in person. Gaming on this monitor is great and I haven't had any issues. I wish it was a bit brighter but not a big issue. The monitor is well worth the price..",5
11250,658,Liked the screen. Picture quality is good.but eye care is basically an eye wash. I had to manually reduce the brightness to make is suitable for eyes.,4

11252,660,"I was used to my Dell 27 inch earlier and felt thats a bit better to this but this has the reading light effect and blue light filter so can compensate a it there ... rest value for money, close your eyes and buy if budget is concern.",4
11253,661,"Well BenQ has really a Excellent Brand. The Gw2780 has more than others offers and quality feels how premium it's this.
Yiu don't believe Gw2780 build quality is so hard. The boys who delivered benq will offered me very poor delivery. In fornt of ne they drop the led from bike. And my impression is shocking well i check properly the product and then paid. So that's why benq is more than a price segment product.",4

 Review after using this monitor for about 7 months

Pros :

Excellent picture quality for the price.
Nice viewing angle ( no colour shifta ).
Looks stylish with very narrow bezel.
No stand hight issue like other monitors for multi monitor setup.
Anti galre really helps in bright environment.
Not bad for gaming though its a 60 hz panel.

Cons :
Crapy speaker.
Light sensor not very well-calibrated.

Overall a very good product for work or casual gaming.
Highly recommended.",5
11255,663,I liked the monitor. Its nice look and having awesome picture quality.,5
11256,664,"I was looking for an economical monitor to connect my work computer to work from home . This monitor fits my requirements very well . I paid 9.5k which seems to be more than what other reviewers have paid ... but it serves its purpose well .. the item was received promptly . The monitor works out of the box with my Windows 7 enterprise , Windows 10 and MacBook Pro 2019 laptops and I did not need to install the monitor drivers .",5
11257,665,"Never used an Monitor always used laptops , although i know there are many others monitors this is a good monitor for beginners who would use it for normal work or reading . There will be little stuck pixels here and there but i have seen in any displays these days . A good monitor for normal use .",4
11258,666,"It is almost 2 years, the monitor display has gone bad. It is non reparable as company stopped sparr parts.

Beware of Benq brand, go with other brands.",1
11259,667,After a year warranty worn out. Monitor stops working. Not detecting input signal. I should have chosen some other like samsung or LG l. Benq service center miles away from my place.,2
11260,668,"Very good product, Its features of multiple input connections is really helping me i have connected my three laptops to it and it automatically detects the input of whichever is on and we can override by buttons to choose the source. Picture clarity is excellent. Only one issue is that in the nearby switches if any one switches off or on this monitor will restart .",5
11261,669,"Brightness is good but the adjustment settings not brightness are for good.
Eye care working very fine
Screen quality according to price good but sometimes when you using Microsoft product like paint, word or other software some time you feel bluri view i think this because Microsoft software not full hd icons.

Overall conclusion 4/5 to this screen
Design i like and fliker technology fully working",4
11262,670,"Best in class.
Not for gaming perpose.
Quality is good enough.
Ambient light sensor is working well.
Boot time is also fast.
I use with VGA cable.
Because my laptop don't have a hdmi port so there is little lower quality for small words.",4
11263,671,During first one year monitor flicker observed 4 to 5 times .... Let's see,4
11264,672,The monitor started to blink frequently. It goes off and after a few seconds comes back. The power connection has no issues. It is just the blinking which is irritating. I was very happy with the product until now and thought of adding one more same monitor to my display. But from when this strated it is a serious work hindrance and I will wait to see their service quality.,3
11265,673,"A good buy for the price, but do keep in mind that the display is not ultra sharp, and you will notice this especially if you are coming from a QHD or higher resolution display. There is no height adjust, we can only change the tilt angle.",4
11266,674,"AFTER USING ONE MONTH
1. GOOD PACKING 100/100
2. SEAL PACK PRODECT 100/100
3. DISPLAY COLOR & EVE CARE 100/100
4. EXTREMELY GOOD POWER CABLE 100/100
5. VGA CABLE POOR QUALITY 30/100
BAD THING IS NO HDMI & AUDIO CABLE IN THE BOX. IF YOU ARE USING VGA CABLE, YOU NEED TO BUY MALE TO MALE AUDIO CABLE FOR SOUND.",5
11267,675,It's well for Normal usages,4
11268,676,Picture quality good,5
11269,677,Picture quality is very good. Loved it. Very classy and height adjustable feature is very good. It suits me and for my kid as well. I bought 24 inch and it is good enough for dual screen . It is good for working long hours,4
11270,678,I just received the product yesterday the initial impression is good also I would like to say that the display is really good on eyes and the picture quality is not that good as I had a costly monitor before but I will get used to it,4
11271,679,Its good monitor with low budget. But the product title says 21.5 inch. but product description says dimension is 48.9 x 18.3 x 39.2 cm. So highest length 48.9 cm = 19.25197 inch. So WHY THE PRODUCT TITLE SAYS it is 21.5 inch?,4
11272,680,"My first monitor, although i have been planning to buy same for almost a year. By far, this is the best in the market monitors that I have been using for almost a month and I can't complain. Full worth of 17K for 27''. I am using it mostly for software development, watching movies online and gaming. Although picture quality is not upto the mark since it supports only 1080p.

If you are on budget and looking for a monitor, go with this one. Its definitely worth it",3
11273,681,Picture quality is great and truly anti glare,4
11274,682,"The picture quality is perfect, you get the full 1080p resolution and the images appear crisp.

Brightness is very good, and while it‚Äôs not enough to combat the brightness from a window, the matte finish does help.

Gaming isn‚Äôt a big let down, but the frame drops are apparent when traveling at high speeds and ghosting is visible. However, it does work very well with consoles such as PS4s.",4
11275,683,this is a verry good product.,4
11276,684,"It is enough big size monitor to work at home or office. Colours are good, text is crisp and clear and most important I feel is Auto brightness adjustment feature, It is very useful when you are working in low light, if you are graphic designer and concerned about colours you can keep it off. Cable management system is very good. Only con is it's base is not sturdy.",5
11277,685,One of the best 24 inch monitor in this price range. Picture quality is decent. Refresh rate is satisfactory for moderate gamers. I use it for editing works. Auto brightness feature is not too helpful but it's OK. Bezel is very thin which looks great. But there is some gap between the screen and the plastic cover which can accumulate dirt over time. But overall this is the best monitor under 10K I could get after doing a lot of research online.,4
11278,686,Just go for it,4
11279,687,"The display is as advertised. Speakers are a little low on the volume but sound clarity is good.
Removing 1 star because the angle of the screen is fixed and is a little downward. This is irritating as I cannot change the angle..",4
11280,688,"Product is excellent. The rate dropped by Rs1700 incleuing discount, one day after delivery. Now available at 14% reduced price.",4
11281,689,Audio not sufficient.Not covering all web site full page,4
11282,690,"Got it few days ago. I have to say that its a bang for buck monitor. With a bit of tweak I am getting close to accurate colors. Watching movies on this is an amazing experience. You can also play games but if you don't want that latency of 5ms then go for other monitors, otherwise it's a really good monitor in this price segment.

Just go for it.",5
11283,691,"This is my 2nd LED monitor from BenQ. Earlier one was BenQ V2200 Eco model which i bought approx 8 years back which is still working great. When i looked for 2nd monitor for my needs, i evaluated various models and narrowed down to this one. On the very first day, i thought the monitor was bright and less in saturation levels (in comparison with my earlier BenQ). After the initial use of couple of days, this monitor proved to superior on all front (Clarity, eye friendliness, etc) and you will never get tired of working with this monitor. It is eye friendly and the in-built display modes are quite suitable as it is. No customization is required. Now, I mostly use this monitor for all my needs. Go for it and never regret it. You can also watch youtube for comparison with other monitors before making the purchase!",5
11284,692,Very good color and performance but it flickers when connected to mac. It is flickering at specific intervals for unknown reasons.,5
11285,693,"The 16A plug in the power cable took away all the excitement after getting the product delivered and unboxing it. This came out of the blue, wasn't written in any specification or feature list.",3
11286,694,"Good for eyes- love the eye care feature. I used BenQ external CD Writer in 2002 worked excellent. Taiwanese company known for its quality.

Thought the monitor was made in Taiwan, seems they made it in China.

No HDMI cable included- found it awkward, with hdmi expected a hdmi cable. Only vga cable included.

Fortunately I have ordered mini display port to hdmi for my Mac book air. So could connect it immediately!!",5
11287,695,BenQ brand always good and chipper in price.,4
11288,696,"Good product but don‚Äôt know why, 15 amp plug is given
The problem with such plug is that when power goes off, monitor also stop working as inverter connection is only in 5 amp supply points
This doesn‚Äôt draw so much of current, this easy change will help a lot",3
11289,697,Good,3
11290,698,Not a worthy product.,2
11291,699,Received damaged screen monitor. Didn't expected from BENQ and Amazon!!,1
11292,700,"I needed more space along with my macbook pro and after looking at the ratings I bought this. Most of the time I work using terminal app and font is not crisp, letters are faded and pixelated when used with small fonts. Color reproduction is awful. Now i regret the purchase as this can not be returned (replacement is available but that will not serve my purpose). Instead I should have purchased 24"" monitor. If you use very large fonts and internet browsing or entertainment is your primary purpose, then go for it.

If you want decent resolution on 27"" inch go for WQHD/QHD, but not full hd.",3
11293,701,Sound quality is not good,2
11294,702,"Perhaps the best thing that I bought this diwali.
My eyes are loving it.
The monitor's in-built sensor automatically controls the brightness according to ambient light and keeps your eyes happy.
The in-built speakers are OK, I use external speakers anyway.
The picture quality is right there at the very top.
This monitor is a big value of money.....actually it's a bargain at this price.",5
11295,703,"For the price, this monitor offers the best features.

For gaming, one might want something with less response time but this works for me as I play mostly casual ones.
Picture quality is good. Colours are vibrant.
Brightness is more than enough. I set it at 30 out of 100.

2 HDMI ports was the USP for me. And the IPS display was a must. No other monitor have it in this price range.

One HDMI for laptop extension and another for Raspberry Pi. This serves a real good purpose.",5
11296,704,Great product from Benq. Guys go for it blindly. Such a quality monitor. Brightness is extraordinary. I was using Acer LCD monitor since 2009. For the first time I'm using IPS monitor. Great difference i can see from both. I'm loving and using daily. Matte finish display is an advantage thay doesn't affect ur view from sunlight through window. Previously i have that issue. Now no issues with this Matte finish display.,5
11297,705,This is a good product.. but unfortunately I am not sure after 2 months of buying there is white line at top corner of the monitor and suddenly it will disappear and again it will come...,4
11298,706,"Works better for me so far. Awesome and sleek product especially with three ports display port,hdmi and vga.

But only con is the speaker output is very low and u can't use that for anything. Needed a seperate speaker unit.",4
11299,707,Monitor is very good and you can use the JIO set of box.,5
11300,708,"Seller deliver me a old mfg. Product. Picture Quality is nice, anti glare function is very nice. But speaker sound makes disappointed. Very low sound output. Actually I purchased it because its having HDMI and inbuilt speaker. Don't buy this product if you searching for good quality of inbuilt speaker sound.",3
11301,709,"I'm used to 27 inch HP 4k monitors at office. Needed something similar for home. Although not 4k, this screen is just perfect- sleek in looks, big screen and comparatively cheaper than most others. The bezels are incredibly thin and give a matt look. Only concern that the neck height is not adjustable which you can fix by keeping it on a stand or a book if you want to.",5
11302,710,"what a masterpiece. i have bought it for my official work and long sitting , and this monitor not disappointed me.
It has an eye strain and pain control hidden feature. kidding.
you can easily use it for long hours without getting irritated.. very good , though the price is little high compare to other brands but worth buying.
Just pick the one and go for buy if you want a class in limited range.",5
11303,711,"The design is very good, sleek and slim. I got the monitor in good packaging and with it i received 1 hdmi cable, 1 monitor power cord, warranty card, instruction manual.

Picture quality is excellent for development work. Has different types of reading mode in built.
Will recommend it to anyone looking for monitor for work. Note: its not a gaming monitor.",5
11304,712,"I was thinking to buy LG ultra wide 25 and finally decided to get Benq 27 since screen size is almost similar and screen width will be more on comparison. However since I‚Äôm not an hardcore gamer.It‚Äôs serves my purpose - presentation , documentation, minimal gaming ( lite ). Edge to edge display with every minimal bezel makes this unique at this price range.Product packaging was good, timely delivery and easy to install.",5
11305,713,I ordered this product for 8800 and the product I got was damaged. Now the product is available but for more than what the actual intial price.its a good product but too hard to get for a reasonable price. Disappointed with the sellers.,5
11306,714,"Please note these are use and throw kind of models if there is any slightest damage to the screen.
So either be sure to protect the screen or go for vendors who provide replacement or even repair with additional money for replacement.
For this model there is no replacement screen in BenQ site/service center/Aliexpress/ebay - nowhere on the Internet",2
11307,715,"Good design with multiple ports that allow to keep my laptop dock (for my windows laptop) and a minidp cable (for older MacBooks) both connected at all times.

Audio output is decent, but highly recommended to connect an external speaker (monitor has a stereo output jack) if you wish to use this for music, movies or games.

Pixel density is fine (I sit about 1.5 feet away) and overall colours and picture quality is better than the Dell monitors I use at work.",5
11308,716,Perfect for long sitting hours in front of monitor. Perfect for office work,4
11309,717,I have been using this monitor from around last 2 months. It is very good for regular purpose. It is not meant for and I have not used it for Gaming so can not comment.,4
11310,718,"I am not a gamer so the rating given for gaming represents ""I do not know"". As I am using it for software development work it serves my purpose fullest. It has good brightness range to take care of daylight as well as night work situation. I did some photo editing as well and found the colors natural and not adding any tint. Did not do any extensive color tests as I am not going to use it for serious photo/video reproduction. I do coding and this monitor works for me.",5
11311,719,The sound quality is very poor..with a 27 inch screen.. one sits a bit away.. however I have to use external speakers to listen..the in built speakers are very poor.. very low sound in spite of keeping at max level,4
11312,720,"Product packing was really good and it includes HDMI cable as well.
If you're looking for a cheaper option for just programming, netflix and stuff connected to your laptop, then definitely a good buy. But if you have to do anything like remote connection, light designing work or light gaming etc.. then probably you might want to spend a little more..

Now manufacturer/product issues and which costed the rest of the three stars:
- It's not an edge-to-edge display (check my first image & it's quite easily visible)
- Ghosting issue (especially while on remote connection)
- Games like Asphalt 9 cannot be played easily (fps issue)",3
11313,721,"Really like to menu and buttons operation, very convenient.
Screen images guide the button placement, no need to look at the buttons.

brightness adjustments based on ambient light are effective.
resolution is only FHD, whereas 2K resolution would be appreciated for this size",4
11314,722,"Best in range and compared to other brands, been using for mid - high level gaming at its good. If 60FPS is not a problem for you then totally worth it.
Played games like GTA V, CSGO, Brawllhalla, apex legends all played smooth.",5
11315,723,Audio is poor,4
11316,724,Working like a charm for me. Picture quality is also very nice. Don't buy it for inbuilt speakers as that is very low volume and isn't of any use. But overall product is really nice.,5
11317,725,Picture Quality is awesome. Photos may not justify picture quality. Sound output is also very good. For console gaming it is good at 60hz refresh rate. Can't notice any input lag. No deadpixel till now. Sturdy build quality. Text is crisp and clear. Anti glare is just awesome don't have any kind of reflection. Better to manually adjust brightness & picture mode for better experience.,5
11318,726,Prices high compared to product quantity,4

11362,770,"Go for it .better than lg and other similar brands
It is sturdy : Crisp images:allow split screen has 2 hdmi
Speakers are not good but audio out is provided
Works perfect in screen share and most imp matte and anti glare with eye saver tech...a total vfm product ..netflix and hdr not checked pls cnfrm if u require ....as i didn't....hope this helps..yes thanks amazon...",5
11363,771,The display is nice but the speakers are just atrocious,4
11364,772,"Nice, value for money.",5
11365,773,Monitor only for working purpose not for games or movies,4
11366,774,"In this price range this is one of the best monitor in the market. With speaker and audio jack can be used as TV as well. Although sound is very less but ok.

Picture quality is also good and so far I find it very good monitor with eye care technology.",4
11367,775,"If your a gamer just search for the same size model from BENQ with VA panel instead of it , coz it's frequency rate is 60hz and response time 5ms . Other than gamers whoever you may be no matter what the purpose is just go for it . By far the best of best monitor especially for graphic designers coz it has a brilliant color settings and picture quality . Being an artist myself , fell in love with BENQ the movement I saw my logo on the start of windows .",5
11368,776,"Audio output speakers in the monitor is not working properly. very feeble output. Same sound at 20% and 100% volume adjustment., provided in the Monitor. Tried every adjustment in the system by maximising output from the system. When connected to external speaker from the headphone output of Monitor, getting good volume. Please analyse and see whether it's a defect in the speakers.
All other features are very good and I liked the product.",3
11369,777,"The eycare technology and the Adaptive Brightness are the main takeaways. Ever simce i changed to this monitor the dark circles and redness in the eyes have reduced very noticeably.
It is a good monitor for gaming purposes and the picture quality is also great. The speaker on this monitor are not that loud but they do the job. Who uses monitor speakers anyway?
The black is not that black in this monitor or maybe some settings are needed to be done. Prefer this monitor at this price over other overrated monitors.",5
11370,778,"Very Very happy with this monitor. It is of best quality. Some people are reporting ghosting but I never faced any such kind under default setting and default setting of this monitor perfectly fine with me and have no inclination to change it. Regarding the sound quality of built-in speaker, I admit that volume is low but not that you can't here. Screen are non-glossy and non-reflective which is good for eye. Monitor stand is hard and sturdy which is great. Edge of the bezel is thinner than that of my laptop. Delivery was fast - monitor delivered to me two days before time. Overall, am extremely happy with this BenQ monitor....",5
11371,779,"this is the best monitor in it's class. I compared HP monitor which refresh rate was 12ms. but this benq monitor refresh rate is 5ms. which is good for gaming.
I liked cable arrange in it's stand is very convient.
I didn't like is it's dual stereo speaker which out put is very low and poor sound quality.",4
11372,780,"The blue light filters works well and make it comfortable to read for long time... bezel is narrow...only issue I am facing is that when blue filter is enabled in reading mode monitor does not allow to vary brightness or other picture settings...it's prest...without filter enabled settings can be varied. The auto brightness adjust is an added feature, though it works... It does not make much difference to the picture....in addition to providing setting to vary sensitivity they should also have provided gain",4
11373,781,I liked the Monitor,4
11374,782,"Pros:
looks good enough
IPS vieweing angles are just fine
Sound is just okay

Cons:
This product has issues with color reproduction
Every time laptop goes into power down mode or we have a reboot, this monitor needs to be explicitly detected using windows drivers to detect. This doesn't happen with any of the three other monitors I have",3
11375,783,"My son uses this for his online classes. The quality is adequate for home use. However, recently the monitor flickers for 30 mins and goes back to normal after. This is quite strange for a product which is brand new.",4
11376,784,Good,4
11377,785,"i purchased this monitor and the internal panel was damaged within 3 months. after long follow up for 2 months. i got reply from customer service that it was broken by external force ..they never replied to my follow up emails. the company said enginner will visit site but he never did. i also followed up with amazon regarding the issue. although their service is generally good, i did not receive any reply from amazon regarding the issue despite follow ups . maybe because it was out of return / replacement period.

although there is no visible damage in display, its not covered by warranty. the cost of the panel is same as the new monitor (rs. 8000). besides, they are not available in india. hence i will be cautious of buying benq again. while it was working the display quality was good but after sales service was disappointing. i purchased another dell monitor from amazon.",2
11378,786,Smooth font and clear text. I had hp 22es but it was different and i got eye strain. Got this one and used 0toper contrast + sharpness + blue light filter on. You won't feel it after several hours. Buy a pair of this and use for development. At this price point is good.,5
11379,787,"The built quality is perfect. Features like, use as vertical monitor is excellent. but
HD resolution is not enough for this 24inch monitor if your going to use this fulltime work.
the Texts are not sharp enough. especially if you have online classes or want to watch YouTube tutorials, even with HD resolution with good internet speed, texts are too blurry and totally hurting eyes.
I am going to try QHD monitor.",2
11380,788,"The BenQ 27 is an amazing monitor the most interesting that I loved about this monitor is its slim bezels on the sides and top. I've connected it with Laptop and the output quality is uncompromised and looks good. it also has an inbuilt speaker (but I never used it because it's not good in my opinion).

Moreover, the texture on the display is well finished with Matte so it could block glossiness and reflection. The monitor comes with a control panel to adjust different settings related to colors and sound. It also comes with a set of Color schemes preset, which are also customizable. Right beside the control panel buttons, it has a power LED indicator too.

My overall experience with this monitor is amazing.",5
11381,789,"Good quality , anti glare",4
11382,790,I use it mostly for official use and it meet my expectation to that end. However video quality while watching videos and movies is not as good.,4
11383,791,Monitor build quality is good. Color rendering is really good,4
11384,792,Very nice For editing,5

11386,794,"Bought 27 inch monitor. super slim. aweome picture quality.
However, comes with 16 A plug which doesnt fit in the standard Indian power socket.",4
11387,795,Very good & styles advance system monitor,4
11388,796," Freedom sale: my first benq monitor, first impression (keeping the price in mind) ‚Äúoutstanding‚Äù picture quality is the best you can get in a 8k monitor.
I know a lot of people would rather go with LG because of its name specially in India but then you wouldn‚Äôt know if you don‚Äôt try the other brands.
I wanted to have a 24‚Äù monitor, and this one is a beast both look wise and the price wise.

Monitor is bright enough.
I spoke to benq support and they said my monitor has three year of home visit warranty which is a plus point.
Go for it guys.
F&D sound bar is what I am using with this monitor and it‚Äôs pretty good to the ears",5
11389,797,"Very good picture quality, only volume is slightly low. Can increase with additional speakers.",4
11390,798,Good product.. Working fine from 3months... Only problem is it's big pin which is something unusual,4
11391,799,"Good quality product.
Only bads:
1. Return or replacement not possible for any higher model.
2. No HDMI cable included only VGA
3. Connectivity via vga is not working so not sure if my laptop accessory vga port is faulty or monitor vga or vga cable.",5
11392,800,Great,5
11393,801,Monitor is averagely good. They shipped a wrong power cable ( 15A) with the monitor so i had to buy a 5A myself. No easy way to reach support. The form factor looks fine. Overall I may have just gone for a dell. The audio is ok for the price and helps to atleast watch videos without an external monitor.,3
11394,802,Worth for money....,4
11395,803,"It has a thick frame around display, and wight is little bit high. Otherwise it is worth to buy at this price
Speaker volume is very low at its max level
No HDMI cable box in the box (Only VGA)
Really easy to install it on table using its manual
Build quality is Good
And finally different modes of color settings are good",5
11396,804,"The monitor is perfect for work for home. It's heavy (not flimsy) and sturdy. The design is understated just like to my taste. The best feature is adaptive brightness which control the brightness throughout the day and night and do not strain my eyes during long working hours. As I do just office work on the monitor, I am not sure about the picture quality or gaming performance.",5
11397,805,"Definitely worth the money. Adding the mount accessory, I am able to use it with its full potential. Durable for sure.",4
11398,806,"Good monitor but it could be supplied with 5A plug instead of 15A. The plug is too large i'm using with adapter.

Picture Quality is good. worth of cost 11250.

After 15 days the moniter not working lines came",1
11399,807,"They should give smaller 6a switch plug. Though, benq was quite responsive to send new wire with 6a plug when requested",3
11400,808,"Great monitor for the budget
Just that the eye care and brightness protection doesn't work well as advertised.!",5
11401,809,"Can watch movies from Amazon Prime, and Netflix on a bigger screen then my earlier monitor, don‚Äôt know how to control the brightness for working with PC ..
Any suggestions please comment..",5

This display really awesome, you will never feel strain in your eyesüòç.
The picture quality is also great.
You can go for it, it will be surely beneficial for your usage.",5
11403,811,Using for online education,4
11404,812,First of all this is my very first product from Benq.I am not that much aware of this company. I am very much confused before buying this product anyway after continous search on Internet I made a list for the 27 inch monitors to be purchased. Almost all leading brands monitors are above 18000 rupees however I got this product below 15000 rupees. The performance of the product is awesome. I bought this monitor for reading purpose especially for the PDF reading in a very big screen. This screen serves the purpose with reduced glare and good clarity. Those who want to purchase a big screen with reduced price with good performance and good clarity you can buy this benq 27 inch monitor.,5
11405,813,"There is no option to reduce Brightness, though blue light is filtered, we are unable to reduce the brightness which is stinking eyes especially during nights and brightness sensor though working it doesnot make difference to the brightness and we are ending up using more tubelights to reduce screen glare and thereby ending up in using up more electricty, so the purpose of eye care is not solved during nights.",3
11406,814," One of the best monitor in such a low price, like other people told that not good for programming and CLI ,but I am using it and no issue at all,

It has all features like sound, document reading mode and smart eye...",5
11407,815,"In the first month monitor flickered a little but then was fine. And now, within 3 months, there is a broad white line around it with very high flickering. Called cust care for technician to come, he keeps calling everyday but hasn't visited from last 2 days. Ridiculous",5
11408,816,Been using it for 6 months now .... amaizing,5
11409,817,"Hi,

Overall performance of this monitor is fantastic If I would compare with other Brands Its suitable for those who is working hours long in front of the system and Its clarity and brightness is far better than other monitors. Its a good product and delivered to me on time by amazon delivery partners.",5
11410,818,good,4
11411,819,"Ordered it mainly for WFH, display quality is good but not the best in this range.
The inbuilt speakers are totally useless, better to use external speakers.
Not doing any gaming so cannot comment on that.",4
11412,820,"overall, its a great purchase.

Pros: good form factor, sleek looking design, the frame around the screen is slim. It has speakers inbuilt, with headphone jacks (audio and mic). colors are nice, brightness and sharpness is nice.
cons: black color for the screen is not a nice black. even with adjustments, the black is slightly like a dark grey. i wouldnt recommend for photo-editing if you are a professional or particular about the quality.",5
11413,821,Awesome clarity but comes with a 16a plug,5
11414,822,Power plug that is provided will not fit in your normal sockets. You will have to either buy another plug or some sort of convertor. I already had a spare plug that I am currently using,3
11415,823,"Amazing monitor.. I am using from last two months. Great in picture quality resolution, office work. üëå if you are looking for monitor of a price around 10 k it is best.
I have not faced any issue..",5

11421,829,Good product at this price,3
11422,830,Received power adapter does not fit in normal indian socket. Need a special 16A power adapter to make this monitor work. Recommended not to buy if you are an Indian resident.,3
11423,831,"The monitor works best for usual day to day official work. Colour and Brightness are good. It is not a gaming monitor, hence do not expect a high refresh rate. Overall the build quality is great. It is not truly bezel-less. I am attaching pictures taken of my two monitors kept side by side. The left one is Benq and the right one is LG LED.
You can say it is a thin bezel, but still, there is an overall 1cm gap between the actual screen and the outside edges of the monitor.
In all cases, you can go for it considering the price.",5
11424,832,"Except for speakers everything is good at this price point. Not recommended for those who purchase a monitor with speakers. Even if you turn up the volume to 100, the output is only 1 volume.",3
11425,833,"Picture quality is very good.
Anti glare is not as expected.

I am using aoc IPs panel earlier but the picture quality, color reproduction is very good for this model. I am using it my office work.",5

11427,835,"The warranty is not 39 months as mentioned , it's 36 months from date of manufacture or bill whichever is earlier.
The day I purchased this , I got a 1 year old product with , so effective warranty I got is only 24 months with no fault of customer. This is tricky and not fair .

1 star to Seller for this",3
11428,836,Good Monitor,4
11429,837,I really like this product and quality also good. Thanks!,5
11430,838,I wanted to return this monitor due to several problems but Amazon wouldn't replace or return. Reason why Amazon is falling down.,1
11431,839,"This monitor comes with a LARGE 16A power plug. This is commonly not available in Indian homes. Forces us to buy expensive converters and Extension boards. Benq needs to pay for that or provide another option of different cable in the box.

When you are charging so much for monitor, you cannot provide a small extra cable.
Pathetic really !!!!!!

Can BenQ answer this query?",1
11432,840,"Why you go for an imac display; spending lot of money...go for this. But be aware about ports including the display port graphic card port..other external ports. This one have several ports..
I have an I mac as well..

Anyway, it's a value for money product. Good fit for someone who uses it occasionally. Not recommended for you are going to stare at the monitor for around or over 8 hours a day. For such use cases, better to go for Dell ultrasharp monitors. They are costly, but your eyes would thank you for sure.",4

11439,847,I get kind of a yellow tint . Average monitor,3
11440,848,This product is good for watching your favorite movies but certainly not for the serious gamer. Inbuilt speakers do not produce that much sound. You can hear up to 1.5 meters (I give 2 star for (speakers).,4

11446,854,Such a nice product,5
11447,855,It needs a big power socket. Buy it along with monitor. Also plan for hdmi/ daub adaptor as it has only one hdmi poet and other is display port,3

Monitor looks sleek
Multiple brightness modes
Can tilt vertically to some extent

Minus:
16 amp plug. Can be hard to find a matching plug point

Speaker Sound is not that good but it doesn't matter to me much as I have an external speaker attached with. Came with HDMI and main cables in Indian version so no need to purchase extra anything. Gaming not sure as I don't play.",5
11453,861,"Attention: 15 AMP socket required for this monitor to work.

In general, we had 5 AMP socket in our home. I had to install a 15 AMP to make this monitor work.

Please consider this before buying. There is no clear indication about this in product catalogue. That is the reason I gave only two star",2
11454,862,"Probably I am one of those few people to get hands on both Dell 2419h & Benq GW2480T.

I must say that both of them are plagued with manufacturing defects, such as backlight bleeding and uneven rendering of colours. Typical Chinese with no quality control. Only went with them as there were no alternatives.

The backlight bleeds can be noticed on darker videos (especially on right side corners), and uneven colours can be noticed with white/grey backgrounds where some parts of screen may appear as yellowing and rest whiter.

This is my 3rd monitor after returns/replacements and still face the same issue. I thinking to retains this piece not because it's better than remaining ones, but rather because I'm tired of this replacement/returns process.

If you trust any local shop then I would suggest to go with it rather than online in amazon, because getting a good electronic product (especially displays) is matter of pure luck here.

Update:
Found dead pixel on bottom left part of screen. So enough compromises, returning it off.",2

Cons: don't expect more for audio sound.",4

Good picture quality
Value for money.
Supports both VGA and HDMI (one port).
Comes with HDMI cable for 24 inch monitor.
Good monitor for office work (Programming).

11487,895,"After seeing so many good reviews, I got this monitor hoping I‚Äôll get a good product but was disappointed. Seller was Appario.

Firstly, the amazon packaging was torn and damaged from one corner. It shows how carelessly they have handled a delicate product like this.

Coming to monitor:
1) I see the bottom bezels are not uniformly aligned to the screen, this was causing heavy screen bleeding from bottom.
2) It claims it is an IPS display but it‚Äôs just a cheap LCD. The blacks and dark colours are horribly faded. Details are lost in shadowy parts of scenes.
3) It claims to have 178 degrees viewing angle but if you‚Äôre sitting even 45 degrees from the centre the details start to get faded.
4) And about speakers I‚Äôm still wondering why they even bothered putting that in the first place. Total wastage.

I don‚Äôt know if all the monitors are like this or if I got a lemon. I‚Äôm starting to doubt that this is a refurbished monitor and used a cheap IPS or LCD panel which gives its such a faded look, but the other reviews said that it‚Äôs ok to have that much backlight bleed into their screen, so maybe it‚Äôs the product itself. Anyways I‚Äôm not happy about the product being an IPS display behaves like a 10 year old LCD models.
Either ways I‚Äôm returning it never to buy this product again. I‚Äôll rather check the new LG or Samsung models which I hope would give the IPS display of the quality which they claim on their products.",1
11488,896,"I'm using it for work from home and the picture quality seems good. There is some slight screen bleeding on the edges, but are acceptable for this price range.",4
11489,897,Everything is good but monitor stand is not as tough as previous models.,4
11490,898,"Picture quality is good as described
But I reduced 1 star because I had 1 dead pixel. I expected good quality control from benq",4
11491,899, Very nice product which I receive today from Amazon. Thanks to Amazon and service center Person name Mr.Reddy who solve my Problem. He manage me it for quick delivery. Thanks to him more from my side. I am very glad to him and sending me a very nice porduct to my native. Thanks to all service Persons of Amazon again.,5

11493,901,Good,4
11494,902,"Please at least provide a hdmi cable with it.
AND THE POWER CABLE IS LOOSE IT GETS OFF AGAIN AND AGAIN
PLEASE THE POWER SOCKET CONNECTED TO THEE MONITOR

Thankyou",5
11495,903,nice quality-anti glare also,5
11496,904,Everything is good except Power Cable which had big plug size which cannot fit in the normal size plug connecter in our home. Kindly try to sent correctly for others,5
11497,905,"While quality and clarity is good, this does not come with hdmi cable with bkx. So if you add cost of hdmi cable you can buy a better branded monitor.",4
11498,906,Amazing features specially the auto eye care. Couldn't isn't asked for more in 13k. Thank you Benq and And Amazon fire not raising the price during these tough times. I hope I get a good mobile phone as well soon on the Amazon day. Flipkart sale made fool of all customers by raising each mobile phones price by at least 2k,5
11499,907,Really a nice product. No complaints at all. Picture quality is too good. My eyes don't pain if i work for long hours on ialland that's what I wanted. Really fullfill my expectations,5
11500,908,"Sensor feature is just there to increase the price, it workes but not at all useful. If you make that sensor off, then only brightness feature gets enabled and we can adjust the brightness.
Amazon customer service is waste and BenQ technician came but I have more knowledge than him. I gathered information from web and make the pc useful for me.
Overall: terrible experience and my eyes got very reddish and teary eyes.

Please search for a better one first and still if you don't find then only select this.
I chose this product based on good reviews here.",1
11501,909,Value for money,5
11502,910,"Best at this price.
Pro: 27"" is big enough for working.
Splitting screen into two is useful.
Even splitting the screen into four is also comfortable at some situations.

Cons: speakers are useless",4
11503,911,"Nice Screen overall, Go for it.I am using it for CCTV.",4
11504,912,"Amazing picture quality, purchased for wfh and so far great experience",5

11506,914,the picture quality is good for normal working. even for playing high-resolution videos. haven't played video games so cannot say anything about that. but overall the video quality is good. the speaker's voice is a bit low compared to the laptop speakers.,5
11507,915,A very good HD display with eye care technology which helps reduce eye stress. Would have been a perfect display with additional hdmi or a usb connector.,4
11508,916,"Was. Bit wotried as earlier experience ... Buying computer accessories was not good
But this purchase was good .. single day delivery ..
Good quality
Speakers are just manageble ..",4

 I bought 2 monitors on this last Aug, But one of them keep on getting issues like Horizontal pixel lines and flickering problem. So I thought it's my bad luck that I got a manufacturing defect product. So I returned it and requested for a replacement.
The Amazon shipping was too good that the replacement came in 2 or 3 days .. But again this worst horizontal pixel line popped up into the replacement monitor after 1 week. So I returned the replacement monitor too... I wonder what happened to benq.. that their monitor is not even lasting 2 weeks! I tried it 2 freaking times coz I like Benq... Now I'm in confistion that I should again go for benq or I should find some other brand ... Please suggest if you guys got any good ones other than this..because God already gave me 2 chances ... I don't wajt to spoil the third one tbh",2
11517,925,The product comes with 16A power cable instead of 10A,3

11519,927,"Im a hardcore developer , and at times likes to play games , this monitor compelled me to write this review as i hate samsung products . This time i had a wide variety to choose from within my budget of 50k. I had chosen , this one , and after buying when i explored its features and options to adjust display , Im very delight at this product.
Using it with my dell 5520 workstation which is 4k itself.
P.S. : Dont get confuse with 144hz and curved screens if you are not hardcore gamer with budget more than 50k for monitor.",5
11520,928,"The picture quality is very good. 5 stars.
The Audio is useless. 1 star for it.

ONE issue with the viewing is that the screen adjustments are mannual. During the day time Eye care intillegence work, but during the night we have to manually reduce the brightness and the contrast to avoid straining the eves. So this has to be done every day, it's not worth the price. 2 star for it
Over all 3 star",3
11521,929,"It's a perfect example of value for money üí∏.
It has IPS LCD display, it has automatic brightness sensor, it can be tilted without much effort, the cable management is fantastic, the reduced edge display is fantastic, the colour and everything else is fantastic.

11527,935,Best in monitor.,5
11528,936,"Value for money. Best for office use.
Don't expect good sound from inbuilt speakers they are just good to have. Better buy 2.1 Speakers to have best experience while using this for movies and other OTT stuff.",5
11529,937,"The picture quality is ok. If you are using it with a laptop/computer, most of them have the anti glare thing.
I didn't like the in-built speakers at all. The sound quality is too bad. But it comes as a complimentary, so that's ok.
Overall is good. But not too good. I would research more for a better monitor going forward.",3

I found this product as the best in this range which have the required quality without making big holes in my pocket.",5
11532,940,Monitor is very good in terms of picture quality and anti-glare. But came with a 16A plug which doesn't match normal 3 pin socket. Had to buy another chord for this. Company should have provided the normal chord.,5
11533,941,This monitor is very good according to the price. Picture quality is also very good but not for designers. Only 2 problems I found. There is screen bleeding issue and 60hz refresh rate.,3

Another small issue is that no HDMI cable is provided (mentioned in the desc). However, the VGA cable that is provided is too small, barely 1m long.",3
11537,945,"Though I have used dell 21 inch monitor earlier,this 24 inch monitor is fantastic. I thought of purchasing 27 for my daily development work but this is the perfect one for coding. No glare, easy to install. Though it's just 2 hours, I'm very very happy with this product. Thank you Amazon.",5
11538,946,My idea was to build my dream rig a triple monitor setup so I went through a lot of research and decided to go for BenQ 27 inch ips (since I am gamer/digital concept artist/content creator) but soon I learned that this 27 inch is too much for 1080p resolution. this monitor has good viewing angle and no problem with panel or anything but be a smarter choice would be 24 inch insted of 27 because the image feels stretched (by the way works great with my PS4 slim),5
11539,947,Very good product...Picture quality and the response time is awesome. ...Inbuilt speakers are not up to the mark but that's not really need as we have an option for audio out ...So home theatre can be connected via aux. Am using it to connect amazon stick too and it works well,5
11540,948,Good one,4
11541,949,Quality is very good no doubt in that but I feel like the auto brightness yet to be dimmed which makes us feel uncomfortable sometimes,5
11542,950,"Worth it. It didn't mention that the screen is LCD with LED backlighting. This is quite an easy steal for its worth. Helping a lot with my digital painting work and gaming is good as well. Not sure about multiplayer though. If you're looking for cheap options, this monitor is a best buy.",5

Height adjustable helps a tall person to manage the sight",5

1)IPS Display
2)24 Inches
3)thin bezels
definetely this monitor is not perfect because for gaming perspective it is not that good if you have budget gaming pc you can definetely go for this .",5
11546,954,Bad built in audio quality.,4
11547,955,"I used this monitor to build my own cost efficient and stylish AIO! This is a gorgeous monitor with the following specs that fit my needs:
1. Edge-to-edge full HD display which makes it look larger than a 24""
2. Built in speakers
3. VESA compatible - for mounting my NUC box
4. Cable management - to effectively conceal the cables and retain the look of an AIO
5. Not too expensive
6. Good looking base
Cons: It came with one stuck (always on) red pixel. I used PixelHealer program to get rid of it and it's perfect now.

I'd definitely recommend this monitor.",5
11548,956,Nice Picture quality..,4
11549,957,"While this may work well for a Desktop PC setup, the monitor is NOT COMPATIBLE as an external display screen for a retina display device. The text becomes blurry. Also, there is no option on this monitor to disable the eye-care features (which aren't really needed in daylight) making the screen yellowish all the time.",3
11550,958,"The best thing is the adaptive brightness. The elegant slim bezel design is also what i liked.
The price tag suits best with all the feature. Got in 9.7K for 24"" monitor.",4

The product received was broken out of the box. The person who came for the replacement was very rude and came prepared not to replace the product anyhow soever. I totally recommend not to buy this product at any cost as it's very fragile and if an issue comes you won't get any help.",1

eye care is not that much useful",3

After 6 days use, I'm fully satisfied.",5

11563,971,"Purchased this monitor for urgent need by seeing majority of 5-star ratings. Received this item today and unboxed it to find it as a substandard product. Not value for money. Repenting now for my buy since Amazon said I cannot exchange it unless it has some defect in it.

This is pretty old product it seems (2017). There is another new GL series (July-2020) LED monitor from BenQ available at same price(10K), description shows as LED monitor, when I was searching it was in the list recommended by Amazon, bad...

-The picture quality is not good.
-Sound quality is also poor.
-On the box it's mentioned as LED, but backside of monitor it's mentioned as LCD.
-Almost 6 inches of desk width it occupies on the computer table due to it's poor design of stand. This leads to strain on eyes.

Another observation: This 24 inch monitor causing a toll on eyes so don't buy 24-inch for WFH with 2-ft wide computer desk. better go for 22-inch.",2
11564,972,Its a best monitor for who looking in budget monitor for casual gaming and using offic work and stay over time on screen. loved monitor colors and display unit work.,5

BenQ ships this monitor with a LARGE 16A power plus which is used only for Refrigerators, Owens, Geysers and similar electrical equipments that need high Amperes. Can BenQ or Amazon answer this question?",1

The customer care didn't entertain the under warranty product. They claim that they cover the 39 period month warranty, but this one they didn't cover. The reason being dark spot, which surfaced on its own.
My bad luck, I will have to buy a new one but one thing for sure not BenQ",1

Supports HDMI. Comes with a cable. Can be detached from the stand so that you can fit it on the wall. Not very heavy.

11612,1020,"Using since few months and no issues found, great quality of display and 24‚Äù is more than sufficient for all kind of work. Got Deal at attractive price of @8.6K. Built in speakers are not loud enough, need to add additional speakers.
Thanks Amazon and Benq!",5

11616,1024,"I purchased this monitor then i know its pixe density is only 92
While Lg monitor 22"" pixel density is 102

That's why this 24 inch monitor is cheap
Although there used lg panel with low pixel density.
If i know it further then i will go for LG 22"" monitor .",3
11617,1025,Pixel density is low with macbook pro. If you want to read text then go for higher resolution. Good for video streaming.,3
11618,1026,"The color reproduction is quite poor. However, the overall quality is decent for regular office work, but not for gaming / entertainment / graphic processing.
The size is quite large. 24 inch would've been a better fit for home office setups.
Benq drivers are not available for download on Benq website either.

Amazon delivery was very good, but there is no option to return because of poor picture quality.",3

seller should use amazon packaging to cover product..",4

1) anti glare
2) automatic brightness control function

Cons.
1) not a sharpen image
2) districting ips glow

11633,1041,"Bought this @13490rs(2020 june) ...which I believe is an amazing deal.
The picture clarity is just stunning.
Amazon packing was also very good.
Gaming is little difficult with this huge size otherwise watching HD/4k movies is just great.
Side bezels are very tiny, that make this display aesthetically pleasing.

ps: (Malayalam) Onnum parayanila adipoli :)",5
11634,1042,The monitor is good but the HDMI Cable is not of good quality. A little movement of the cable will affect the display and display goes blank.,4

I have got some backlight bleeding due to unsafe packing I believe

Pros:
- Display is great
- Eye care indeed helps
- stand is rock solid
- Bazel is stylist
- Not Made in China",5
11651,1059,"The two in-built speakers are nothing but a joke. Even if place myself right up close to the the monitor (one foot from the monitor...the only thing between me and the monitor is the keyboard), the audio is very low. The volume from this monitor set to max is not even 20% from the single speaker of that of my mobile phone (Redmi Note 7) placed exactly at the same location.

I am not expecting a TV like volume from this. But the speakers are not even audible. I need a monitor with built in speakers to go through some videos etc quickly without having to connect my sound bar etc.

For such an awful speaker volume, they should not describe the product as one with built-in speakers. I am going to have to return this.

I am not going to comment on the picture quality at this point because I have not validated it enough as I have made up my mind to return it.",2

I really appreciate to true reviewers.
Although, my 1st product was defective might because of some issues,

Inbuilt Speakers.
Blue eye protection
Anti Glare eye Protection",4
11670,1078,Noice,4
11671,1079,Let me highlight the negatives. There is no usb port. Connecting a webcam is not possible and you need to run it down to the CPU. Only one hdmi port. The second one is display port and to connect a second device is near to impossible since you cannot find a hdmi to display port cable. Adding that cable to the package instead of widely available hdmi cable would have been an added value.,2

11675,1083,It is a good monitor. It has a great cable path that help to hide the cables. Definitely not for gaming in high fps. It is 60 in max you can get which enough for gaming. But if you are looking for high fps don't buy it.,5

11679,1087,I am not a gamer or a photoshop editor. I just watch youtube videos/facebook/general browsing. For that this is very good. dont know other technicalities. But there is a small Bleed/IPS glow whatever you call but for this price it is acceptable.,4
11680,1088,Crisp video. Sharpness and contrast is nice. Color creation could have been better. Good for normal photo and video editing but not so for gaming. Audio is pretty average. Ergonomic design and build quality is fine. Controlls are well defined but have no toggle switch. No true HDR though picture quality is fairly appreciable.,4

Thanks Amazon for keeping my trust high. Way more to go..",5

11706,1114,This is just perfect. Go for it. It looks like TV screen and make my weekend. This is also great for office use. Using that big screen for working is another level fun.,5
11707,1115,It's not the one for gaming Unless you are having a massive upgrade. It's a bit too faded for antiglare and colour calibration is your headache now. It's ergo is nice and in all its a sleek monitor with its looks. I got it in quarantine and it's been nice till now.,3
11708,1116,A really good and budget friendly monitor that can be used for office work and gaming/multimedia like OTT. It is very easy to assemble the stand by reading the manual booklet. I've just set it up today and started using it. Will update my review if any problems arise. So far so good.,5

11713,1121,Inbuilt speakers are of no use. Picture quality is excellent üëç.,4
11714,1122,The monitor is very good for the price. But dont expect more. It has its own disadvantages in terms of display resolution by design. 1080p in 27 inch will be okayish. Proceed only if u desperately want a big monitor. I used it for personal computing and found it difficult.,3
11715,1123,"The Monitor is Best itself. We get the same Quality as of HP Monitor, which is slightly Costlier than this.
Moreover there is a light Sensor which automatically controls the Display Brightness according to the Light Conditions.",5

11720,1128,"no need to search for other monitors. In this range almost all the monitors have same warranty, service and quality but here is the advantage of price.

Monitor is awesome and BENQ technologies make it perfect for use in night and daylight.
Must buy it..",5
11726,1134,"Good for casual gaming. The only thing holding it back is the refresh rate in this aspect.
Small text may look harsh because of 1080p but can be solved by lowering the sharpness.
Although you might want to look for a higher resolution if text is important to you. The brightness did not bother me.
Overall, at that price it's a really good deal and it looks good with the small bezels.",5
11727,1135,I think the in-built speaker and headphone port do not function. I am still trying to work them out.,4

Quite easy to set up.
And delivery was also timely and we'll packed.",5
11733,1141,"The monitor was delivered by Amazon within a week. Packaging was good and the product didn't have any physical damage. But the monitor doesn't work as per its specifications. Sharing my experience after one year of use as below -

1. The Eye-Care Tech doesn't work at all
2. The default 'Standard Mode' has Contrast & Brightness auto-adjusted to very high levels, so can't work in this mode. Had to switch to 'User Mode' where I could manually set Contrast & Brightness levels
3. Even at Contrast & Brightness levels at zero, the text & other info on screen is clearly visible
4. BENQ has supplied only the older VGA cable not the HDMI cable which are more common
5. Had to buy an HDMI cable separately to improve display quality, i.e. faster screen refresh
6. After connecting monitor with HDMI cable, am able to get audio output thru its built-in speakers, but their volume is too low to be of any use. Hence, I have been using my external speakers
7. Followed up with BENQ Tech Support for more than four months and even after the sensor and main board were replaced after three months of follow-up my issues remain unresolved. I am forced to use the monitor in User Mode with both Contrast & Brightness levels at ZERO, with no Eye-Care Tech functioning either.

I have reduced brightness, contract and then also set it its brightness intelligence but nothing worked out. There was burning sensatio to my eyes just after few minutes of sitting. Finally I returned the product. Not sure the issue is with model or the product which I have received. I'm now looking for other brands like LG, samsung, HP and Dell.

The delivery was also good but when I opened the product, the power plug i got was a 16Amps plug that doesn't fit on any standard power sockets in india. It only fits in the bigger ones provided in the kitchen for heater or the big ones for AC. I tried reaching out to amazon immediately within 2 hours of product delivery but the customer care agent told me that this product cannot be returned and is only eligible for replacement. I asked for scheduling a replacement with a standard power cord and the customer care executive said that he will arrange for that and I will get another call in 48 hours for follow up. I got no calls, there was no replacement pickup organized. Today the return window of the monitor has also expired and I am stuck with this monitor which I cannot use.

11811,1219,"Play Video
 Extremely poor quality product. See the attached video. Within an year, the screen started showing green glow along the borders making everything along the sides invisible. Unusually high light bleeding is also becoming a major concern. And it keeps increasing everyday. I have raised an RMA request and it is still pending approval.

Coming to the product itself, it was a decent monitor at first but keep in mind the fancy features are just gimmicks and not worth it. Inbuilt speakers are useless as the volume is not only extremely low but also distorted. Other feature is the ambient light sensor that claims to adjust the screen brightness automatically according to the light intensity but it has always been a hit or miss and I had to turn it off as it worked sporadically. Full Matt finish and thin bezels are cool.

In short, do not buy it for the extra gimmicks and be ready to face issues like backlight bleeding and Edge glows.",1

11817,1225,"16A power cable provided when that's not even needed for a monitor. This monitor consumes 32W which means on a supply of 230V, the monitor will only draw 0.14A of current. 6A cable (which means the cable can draw a maximum of 6A current - which is fine given the monitor will draw only 0.14A current) with normal sized plug will be much better suited as it can be fit into any plug point. The big plug of the cable provided will not fit in most power sockets except the ones for high power consumption equipments like ACs, refrigerators, geysers, etc. Getting a convertor is quite easy but why even provide such a cable in the first place!",1

The speakers are a joke, my 5 year old laptop has better speakers. and a monitor DOES NOT NEED speakers.

11930,1338,"i ordered my first monitor on 7th June and it had problem with the lcd it had a hairline crack near the right bezel of the display, as I saw the crack I immediately placed a replacement order and it came in just two days on 9th June but the replacement had a bigger issue the top bezel wasn't fully glued in so the dust would've sneaked the way into it destroying the display and thank god that I returned it quickly in my amazon return window cause benq customer care sucks I called them emailed them but no one helped me with this issue so I ended up returning it and getting my amount back, Now I've ordered dell P2419H I should've ordered it first hand cause dell has quite the reputation for the quality displays,
picture quality is great if you can get a good monitor for them also color accuracy is great too but the light sensing feature is kinda buggy when you switch the color presets,
go for this monitor if you have time and you believe in luck cause sure enough my luck wasn't the great with this monitor.
i'd say that spend a couple thousand more and go for the dell or any reputed company which is recognized for its customer service.
i hope this helps",1

Power plug that is provided will not fit in your normal wall or extender sockets ( the plug is the size of the ones Air Conditioners use, quite big). You will have to either buy another plug or some sort of convertor. I already had a spare plug that I am currently using. This needs to be addressed by BENQ and Amazon - what were they thinking supplying this plug with the monitor, seems to be a know issue as others have also mentioned this on reviews but is still unaddressed, otherwise the monitor seems fine, I have just received mine today and just started using it.",1

If you are programmer and looking for a monitor for work purpose , this monitor is not so good. Go for Dellp2419H.

After a lot for research ,I finalised two products . Benq24 and Dell p2419h. There are two problems with Benq as compared with Dell.
1. Stand : As compared to dell , this stand is not up to the mark. Dell stand is the best in the market. You can do what ever you whan to do and it supports it.
2. Display quality : Too much complex to adjust and not upto to the mark as compared with Dell.

Coders, programmers -> don't buy this , go for Dell.

Thanks.",2

I then logged another complaint, and called the company managing the support services, the person was not helpful just stubbon saying this is not a problem until the complete screen is dead. Absolutely useless BenQ support. It is not about photography monitor, its a simple IPS screen issue, I have used IPS monitors all my life and I know about light bleed. I have now given an order for Dell ultrasharp 24inch which has great warranty support stating ""Even if a single pixel is brighter we will replace the complete screen"".

12183,1591,There is absolutely 0 sound from inbuilt speakers. Connected monitor to cpu via hdmi. Also tried connecting 3.5mm audio cable from monitor to cpu still system cant recognise it. Xhanged audio setting from auto to computer no change. Why write fake info abut speakers? Pathetic.,1

Too heavy, yes looks like 4-5kg.... 2nd made in China.

12206,1614,"Initially I ordered for 27"" monitor, and I received 24"". Then it got replaced. And then at very 14th day after I got the replaced product, It's main board got damaged and I was unable to connect using HDMI cable. When I complaint to BenQ Head office at Gurgaon, The team is totally incompetent. Their Manager Deepak Khurana is on leave, and his represent member Om Prakash himself says that he cant do anything without Deepak. Let him return from leave. The entire team just play email - email within their own team only, and the customer just watches the show as an Audience. It's almost a week now and I have still not got any result.

12211,1619,"Looks wise so good.... This is my review just after unboxing. Didn't feel anything special about the display. No option for custom color/brightness/contrast etc settings. Only standard presets like movie, office, reading etc. For text reading minimum 2+ feet is recommended for decent feel. Otherwise you feel like the text is pixelated due to size. Saw couple of images and small video which was very nice.... Will update this feedback after a month of use... Overall worth the penny if you want to watch movies.....",3

12287,1695,The picture quality is nice. I do not have any complain for its display section. However I have failed to use its audio system. I have tried to get output from the speaker using my available devices. It failed to give any sound when the input is given through its hdmi port or audio line-in jack. It appears to me that there is some fault in the section that implements the audio system. It is my suggestion to viewers that you should check both the video and audio system before giving any rating to it.,2
12288,1696,Everything is good but Height adjustment is very bad,3

 I wasted my 16K, this display stopped working within 15 days picture attached. Customer service is very bad they didn't even see the attachments in the mail. If the display is not covered in the warranty then what is the purpose of giving warranty. Really regret my decision to buy it over other good brands like dell, samsung, hp. I would suggest not to waste the money here instead you should go for dell, samsung lg or hp.

Specially mentioning such customer service I have never seen.",1

Till a week back it was working fine and then suddenly when I wake up one morning there is a black line on the screen. I contacted customer support. They registered the call but when the technician visited he said it is damaged and I can't do anything, you better buy a new one as the cost to replace a panel is the same as this monitor (WHAT?). I was keeping the monitor really well and it did not fall at all, had it fallen it would have had some dents, there were zero dents and scratches. In this Oct sale, I purchased the Dell Monitor which should last longer than this BenQ thing. I really thought well of the product after reading the reviews but it indeed turns out of substandard build quality.

1. It cannot be used where ever you want as such high voltage switch boards are not generally be installed

12592,1,"Came with the just the OEM package slapped with invoice but the product was safe
Pros
1. 24 inch screen pixels are small enough u can see it if u try but not bad
2. Ips bleed is not there but there is definitely ips glow but not that bad
3.75 hz but meh i can't tell the difference but again i have 120 hz phone so makes no sense to buy it for 75 hz
4.colors are good movies and games pop out well
5. Comes with a HDMI cable which is neat
6. Build it good and angle of the monitor can be moved
Cons
1,has like a slight yellow tint just like the redmi phone but u could get used to it
2. 75 hz is a gimmick
3. No display port which so bad
4. Ips glow is there not much but dark things will look grey
5.game mode is useless and eye blinding
6.the power cable has a adapter with it which is pretty fragile if it break ur monitor is a brick
Verdict
I would say don't buy this just for the 75hz it's not worth it i would be looking into benq and lg monitor or go big and get a higher refresh rate monitor i wouldn't say this was a waste of money but this definitely expensive for wat it's offering",4
12593,2,"Pros:
1. Good display quality
2. ??
That's the end of Pros

Cons:
1. WHY ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH THERE IS NO AUDIO JACK?!?!!!!
What is the use of HDMI port if user can't get VIDEO AND AUDIO both??
2. IF SOMEONE IS INVESTING 10K ON A MONITOR WHY IN 2022 ANYONE WILL NEED A VGA PORT??
3. Build quality is questionable, Entire build is made of plastic which is fine but for me monitor was always a little tilted no matter how hard I screwed the stand it was still the same.
4. AMD Freesync isn't much affective, you can still see screen tearing.
5. Stand Movement is very stiff, I almost felt like I broke it. Just bad build quality.

If you are only going to use HDMI port and find a workaround for audio then alright but for someone who games on PC and console both this is not good enough.
If you are willing to sacrifice little bit of Visual quality and 15Hz of refresh rate which is not noticeable at all then go for BenQ, Same price but less hassle.
Or
Better bump up your budget go for LG 24MK600M which goes for 13k or less but worth it",4

12609,18,"I have been using a 27"" LG 4K IPS primary monitor that costs 40K+ and a cheap 20"" Samsung TN secondary monitor. The secondary monitor has been showing some signs of old age, and needed a replacement. What I wanted was an affordable monitor that had reasonable picture quality and over all build quality.

To be honest, I only expected an average performer in this monitor, and was pleasantly surprised by it's image quality. The colours are vibrant (don't expect the quality you get from a premium monitor) and it has more than enough brightness.

My premium primary monitor, while having excellent colour reproduction and pixel density suffers from shoddy quality control - I had to replace it five times in the span of 18 months due to various issues ranging from terrible backlight bleeding, colour non-uniformity and image retention. So when bought this rather cheap Samsung monitor, my expectations were not that high. But it outperformed my expectations. For the asking price, this is a steal.

The good:
1. Adequate image quality and colour reproduction. Bear in mind that it is not factory calibrated.
2. Excellent blacks - Even though Samsung says it is an IPS panel, I suspect that it is indeed a VA panel, because I have never seen an IPS panel that is able to render such deep blacks as this monitor does.
3. Really good brightness
4. Relatively lightweight
5. Almost no bezels
6. Adequate viewing angles
7. The VESA mount bracket is on level with the surface, unlike some LG monitors where the VESA screws area is depressed which would make it incompatible with some VESA mounts.
-----
* The pros listed below this point are specific to my monitor, and may not hold true for every one as these things are dependent on QC and is based on your luck.
6. Only extremely minor backlight bleeding - so minor that you'd often fail to notice it. My 40k+ LG monitor has major backlight bleeding issues. So this is a major relief for me.
7. No image retention issues
8. Excellent Black and White uniformity. Grey uniformity is only average.

Cons:
1. The included stand is of low quality. It has sharp rough edges and mold marks.
2. Tilt is very difficult to execute. You have to apply a lot of force to tilt the monitor, sometimes I felt worried that I might damage the monitor.
3. Not so great pixel density. Being only a 1080p monitor, 24"" size makes the pixels too big which force you to stay a bit farther away, otherwise the text does not look smooth. This is not a problem for watching videos or playing games.
------
* Following cons are specific to the monitor I received and other devices may not have these issues
4. Dead pixels - Mine had 5 dead pixels which were prominently around the top right corner. I wasn't bothered by those though.

NOTE:
When I first turned on the monitor I experienced some contrast related issues. The monitor was unable to render certain shades of grey and looked indistinguishable from white. It turned out that this was caused by the setting 'Black level' - mine had it set to 'Low', and once I changed it to 'Normal' the issue was gone.",4
12610,19,Good display. The screen can be tilted up and down. U just have to loose d 2 screws on d stand and tilt it.,4

12617,26,"the ips pannel is awesome. colours are popping. enabling freesync with my amd gpu does boost gaming performance. many peoples were complaining about the downward angle of the monitor. i was also suffering from the same but later found out it was easily fixable. the monitor angle can be adjusted. its just very tight at the beginning. i suggest opening the stand from the monitor then rotating it. allover, a steal deal monitor. 24' ips display for just 9200. also the delivery was awesome. got it within 18 hours.",5

I also didn't notice any light bleeding with this monitor.

Overall, an amazing experience.

It's worth noting that the monitor stand is so tight that you'd think it's not tilt adjustable. However, you must remove the screws from the stand and apply some oil to loosen it. You can learn how to do it by watching YouTube tutorials.",5

Initially I had the same downward tilt, but then I realized that you can adjust the tilt by removing the two screws from the monitor, and holding the stand by itself and pulling it up.

Picture quality and brightness is sufficient for me. It's only for office work. For 10,000 this is a value for money option. I didn't have dead pixel problem either.",5

Best because its Samsung and it has service near to our houses and after sale service is also good so i bought this

Value for money.",4

12665,74,Crisp and clear display with good viewing angles. Easy to work and play and great for videos and movies. Easy installation and simple setup steps. Its almost plug and play.,5

12667,76,"After using it for 1 month. Please find the below points.

1> Eye care mode is very good. I am a developer who spends 10 to 12 hours in front of monitor. My eyes are fine. That is the biggest thing i want to convey.

2> Picture is extreamly good Without eye care mode. But you should be 6 feet awy from monitor otherwise your eyes starts giving problem after 30 mins.

For me it's 5 start product.",5
12668,77,"This is a great monitor option if you're on a budget but looking for something good. And awesome for movies and gaming. I bought this and decided to subscribe few OTT to watch movies cause the quality was awesome.
For gaming, it's a good option. 24inches is pretty good if you're about 10-20 inches away from your monitor. If your monitor is further away. Use a stand or get a bigger one if you're just too obsessed with it.

Pros:
Great quality
Sturdy stand
You can clearly see the difference between 1080p and 4k using this monitor

Cons:
The montior's screen was smaller as shown in the picture. I tried adjusting it but it disappears if it goes before the black part. So not Bezel less

A slight back light bleeding in the bottom left corner and nearby but not visible unless it's pitch black screen.",5
12669,78, Great product for that price,4

Stand made of cheap plastic always tilting.
Angle not really adjustable.
Picture quality is relatively ok but bad with gradient of dark colours.

Overall cheap feeling that is NOT worth the 10k spent on it. Many other monitors in the price range with much better quality.
I tried to return it but as it's not really defective I couldn't so I'm stuck with it and it honestly makes me feel bad for having spent the money on it.",2

3. Design- Design is flawless, looks great

If you are using Macbook M1, please also buy a good quality converter for HDMI

3. 75Hz refresh rate.

7. High quality HDMI provided inside the box.
8. AMD FreeSync‚Ñ¢.
9. Flicker free.
10. IPS LED panel under this rate.
11. It has both HDMI and VGA ports.
12. It can be Wall mounted.

Cons:
1. Even though Amazon shows IPS panel but there isn't any mention as IPS or VA or TN in box or monitor or in paper works.. [I think it is a IPS]
2. Ports and cables available are
* 1 x HDMI (Cable Included on the box)
* 1 x VGA (Cable Not included on the box)

3. No Display port available.
4. No wall mounting bracket included
5. No VGA cable included inside the box. [But still has VGA Port]

12696,105,"I like this product very much.Am using this as a dual screen setup for my laptop for ease of my editing purpose. No strain my eyes becuz of a big screen given with 24 inch 75hz led panel with 5ms response time.Likely to be its a perfect product for me. Its bezzels and all other thing are pefrct and premium and total looks good enough... But i would not recommend this product for an industrial editing purpose this will not give that much performance for an industrial level performance but its very compatible for local uses and for youtubers and all its goodüí•.

This display have many configurations also brightness level is freaking goodüëåü§©.

In this price range this one is a worthy product and you must check it out... üí•",4
12697,106,ITS A NICE PRODUCT IN THIS PRICE RANGE,5
12698,107,"** First review is in last **
Edit-1:
Monitor doesn't work well (Text looks blurry, and display also not as good as with Windows) with Macbook M1 models, problem is most probably with Mac OS that it doesn't turn ON some of it's colour optimisations for some of external device. But as an end user it will affect you with this monitor.

===============

Monitor color looks good.
No edge bleeds.

Monitor stand is firm, but very annoying problem it looks little bit tilted towards front side, and I cannot adjust it as it's not adjustable. But if you don't pay much attention then it doesn't bother much.

I'm going to keep this one, already returned 1 monitor for defects.

Colors looks little yellowish with default settings. I decreased RED and GREEN little bit now looks OK.

I'll post later if any problem I face later.",4
12699,108,Excellent monitor,5
12700,109,"Don't even think about it. This is the best monitor I've used so far. Brightness, color accuracy, refresh rate is best.
I'm using this for AutoCad and Revit (3D House modelling) and it works fine.
1080p videos looks epic in this Monitor.",5
12701,110,Product is good but it is missing two screws required for mounting the screen on to the stand. It was surprising to see that the package didn't have the required accessories to assemble the product,4
12702,111,"While the screen is ok, but I found the plastic quality to be ordinary, also this is not made in India but made in china, which is kind of Mia leading by Amazon",3
12703,112,Updating rating from 1to 5 after using it for 5 months. Very good eye care option which allows us to work for longer time.,5
12704,113,"The most interesting thing about this product is the quality to price ratio. However, one thing I did not like about it is the dynamic range in the darker regions is not adjusted to make gaming in darker regions easier",5
12705,114,"24"" with 1080p is not looking good for development work",4
12706,115,"Product is defective. Thought samsung was the best company to trust. Monitor had issue with power and display.
And the wrost things is that the amazon return police is truly disaster. Its been 15 days that defective monitor is still at home and amazon reschedule return from 15 days.
Seriously amazon is this kind of your trust policy works?",1
12707,116,"As expected, good quality LED product from Samsung. Sufficient brightness, good picture quality, thin bezel gives it a modern look.
I‚Äôm using this as a secondary monitor to my MacBook pro and works perfectly.
Just one problem I would point out is that the display viewing angle cannot be adjusted vertically. Also, 1080p on a 26 inch screen means it has a low pixel density and might look pixelated when looked at closely. When I switch between MacBook screen to this screen, the difference is quite noticeable.
But works perfectly as expected for my use case.",4
12708,117,nice,4
12709,118,"A great external monitor that's just the right size for day to day office work and occasional Netflix/ Prime viewing. Was looking for a monitor to help manage working from home and the increased need for an additional monitor to help with screen share / presentation etc.

Need a little tweak to make this really great.

When this was plugged in at 1st, the text were awful and no matter what I tried to do with the settings nothing seemd to work. Finally after playing with the settings options on the monitor (not via Windows OS) figured out that setting the 'Game Mode Always On' did the trick. The text is razor sharp and smooth transition when you drag and drop windows and other apps. Most of the other settings were kept at factory setting. Monitor is very very bright at 100%. Recommended to dial it down to 20-25%. Hope this helps if you are struggling with the resolution.",5
12710,119,"I do not write reviews but this product made me to.

A brilliant piece of design. One Word go for it.

This Monitor has a option to which can help us switch modes of brightness when it comes to work and gaming(has better brightness).

There‚Äôs one con I have found since it‚Äôs been a week I have been using it. It is that when we duplicate the display or extend the display from our laptop to this monitor and then close the laptop lid, the video running on the monitor has got some lag and you can easily notice it. This gets resolved when we keep the laptop lid open. I dont know if its a software issue with the windows or Is it a problem with the monitor (i dont think its a problem with the monitor, but anyways I am enjoying my purchase and thinking to buy another one in next monthüòä",5
12711,120,"For the price it is decent.
Good quality screen.
Although while running at 75 Hz there were minor glitches but nothing serious yet.

Built quality also seems decent",4
12712,121,"This is a good piece at this range with the reputed samsung branding and LED panel.
Pros :
1. Colours are very deep than other IPS panels
2. Have samsung black mode gives oled panel like deep black.
3. Good overlooks

Cons:
1. Have IPS glow like other panels
2. Need auto calibrated colours
3. Eye staining
4. Stand is too cheap
5. Joystic button is low qualitied should be in the middle
6. Hinge is too tight",3
12713,122,Not much to hate. As of now I am satisfied with the product,5
12714,123,"For a limited time usage this is fine.
But for a user with more than 4 hours of daily usage, this monitor is a worse idea. Its been 4 months since I bought this monitor. At times it was difficult to keep using screen because of the blue lights may be, I tried to switch to eye comfort mode, but that was a big lie. The continues usage of this screen made my eyes hurt when I use it in night light.

Screen resolution of FHD compared to 24"" is not good according to my experience. FHD is should be maximum to 21.5"". The experience may differ to lot of other people. I'm so keen on having better experience from what I buy.

The next thing I wanted to say is, there's a father's dirt kind of visibility in the monitor. Either the quality testing was an absolute crap or mistake from the quality testing team or it would have been damaged due to some fungus or anything like that.

About the refresh rates of the screen, its not that good. If you are listening so close you'll be able to see the trace of shadow on sudden movements. That's something what makes you uncomfortable ask the way. Its like iron powder following a magnet. Not a good experience.

Overall - 2 star
Brightness - 4 star (unbalanced)
Refresh rate - 2.5 star
Eyes comfort - 1 star
Colour calibration - 3 star
Viewing angle - 4 star",2
12715,124,"Received Today. Seems to be good product overall. I found the older model weighs about 700 gram more and build quality is better. Samsung says this is a T35F IPS 75Hz Panel. I don't know if performance wise this is better than the LS24R350FH Model. But feature wise I find no difference. The stand is made of plastic with no aluminium shield, which is available with the older model.

If you buy the newer T35F model please verify if it is really better than the older one.

Another thing the Model I have received is Made in Vietnam.",4
12716,125,stand size is not good for mini place.,2
12717,126,Wonderful product at this price. No issues at all whatsoever. Bezleless makes it even more modern and attractive.,5
12718,127,Nice monitor to use for any type of hard tasks,5
12719,128,Good Product in this price range,4
12720,129,Well it was all good when it comes to spec but the set was missing screws that hold the screen to stand. These screws are what help adjust the angle of the screen. Now I am worried about when the screen might come off.,3
12721,130,"A good product giving excellent value for money so far. Gives good picture quality. I use it for normal PC use, watching movies and editing photos.
The stand however is a bit odd by design. It has a minor tilt down as if the manufacturer expected the monitor to be always placed at ‚Äúhigher than eye‚Äù level. Apart from that, a very good product. Please note that this monitor DOES NOT HAVE INBUILT SPEAKERS.",4
12722,131,"I have been using this for over a year now.
initially the monitor was great.
but after 8-9 months of usage occasionally the monitor would give a greenish tint and some times a blue line would appear.
today after turning the monitor on it turned complete white in 10 min and now is completely unusable.

my last Samsung monitor has been there for 11 years and it still works.
sad to see that the quality has degraded so much.",1
12723,132,Definitely did not meet expectations. Just an average budget monitor and nothing more.,3
12724,133,"if you see the pictures correctly, then you'll find the black spot. Even I replace the item with new one but the new one was same issue, finally I claim for refund today 15.11.22. Display is awesome at this price 9699/- but due to dispute I return this.",1
12725,134,"The product is very good.
It have the option to be get mounted on the wall.
Only the disappointment was, on the amazon website it show's the country of origin as India but actual product received was made in China.",5
12726,135,"Okay, I think this is worth every penny, Picture quality and colors are very good for me. I changed the 60hz refresh rate to 75hz rate and is very smooth. Yet to play some AAA games on it but I'm pretty sure it would't make a big difference. I'm not fan of fps shooting games so i high refresh rate and fast response rate computer is not needed.
To be honest the main cover image on the product looked very pale to me I only bought coz it was under 10k, and I was pretty amazed when i open it and switched it on. It was stunning both design and display. I just hope it will last longer.
Very satisfied with packaging, instructions and delivery. Love you Samsung, appario retail and Amazon ! :)",5
12727,136,Good screen and decent quality. Initially thought stand was bad... But it's flexible and can tilt slightly forward or backward.,4
12728,137,"Like: Vibrant color, perfect black, clear picture
Perfect for programming and watching videos",5
12729,138,"I was really worried during the shipment of this product. Appario are great sellers and I always trust their listings, but 5-6 days for just dispatching??
Ummm... is it because I got it way cheaper than the price listed?
But the product arrived safely and it works amazing (lucky me). The display is really crisp n clear and the details are great! Compared to a VGA 18 inch monitor, I can really see n feel the difference.
Although you can't change the monitor height, the default tilt is pretty good (screen is large enough that you probably won't need to change anything).
My take - definitely go for it (if u get it under 10K)",5
12730,139,A little foreign particle on display. I have noticed this problem after few months of purchase. Quality is good.,2
12731,140,"Play Video
 I opened the package but I didn't find TV remote please send it same address
Thank you",5
12732,141,Overall happy with the product. Just an important point to note that laptops with display port will not be able to use the hdmi cable that comes with this monitor. I have HP Elitebook 840 and it doesn‚Äôt have hdmi port but has a display port. I bought hdmi port to display port cable separately and it works fine.,4
12733,142,"Brought one, a black spot on the display, replaced it. First day run smoothly, next day dead, highly disappointing üò¢üò¢üò¢",1
12734,143,"Nice product, superb picture quality, good for content creation, it has no backlight bleeding issue, it support 75hz so it's ideal for gaming too, it has one HDMI and one VGA, it don't have display port and dvi port but that's okay for me, it has thin bazel which looks beautiful, only drawback is that it doesn't have sound output port, if you are using it with computer then it's okey otherwise you have to buy hdmi to audio splitter to connect speaker.. overall this is awesome product for this price, go for it..",4
12735,144,Worth it and really enjoyable,4
12736,145,Monitor started to flicker two weeks back and not it is unable to detect the input source,1
12737,146,The product has major backlight bleeding problem which is easily visible in dark scenes. That's why I returning this üòî,3

My package cane without screws for stand. Amazon created a ticket and said they will give resolution in 4 days. Called samsung cust care about the issue. They created a ticket and installation team came next day with screws. Free from Samsung.",5
12741,150,After one year of normal wfh use the screen has some kind of light spots on the edges Ran diagnostics to check if the software issue or hraphics card issue but it turnout its the screens hardware issue,2
12742,151,"Brightness is a bit too high, everything else is nice
There is a bit of Backlight bleeding, but only noticable if the screen is fully black

I adjusted the Setting a bit to reduce the brightness and make the colours the same as on my laptop, you can check the pics above for the Values",4
12743,152,"This is a very good display. I use this for my work and also to watch some videos. Do remember to get the settings right (75Hz, Standard, etc). Very easy on the eyes and images feel very rich on the screen. For this price, I am happy with this product.",5
12744,153,"It‚Äôs pretty good for its price, only thing I didn‚Äôt like is that it‚Äôs angle is not adjustable either. It just stays in fixed angle. But I guess that shouldn‚Äôt be a big problem considering it is an IPS panel
The colours seem fine to me.
The Eye Saver mode works as advertised, it doesn‚Äôt let my eyes strain at night.
Basic but good looking monitor at this price point.",4
12745,154, Colors look natural. No eye strain,4
12746,155,"I have been using it for more than 2months now, no issues.",5
12747,156,"It is indeed the best monitor I could have purchased to use along with my MacBook Pro. Good colors and picture quality.

Still for table mount, the viewing angle is bit tilted towards downwards and unfortunately cannot be adjusted. I have to use extra support to extend height under the stand only towards front to set angle to use.",3
12748,157,"Easy to set up and use
I use it on eye saver mode, which makes brightness lesser than usual and introduces a yellowish tint to the screen but it is much easier on the eyes esp if you have to look at the screen for 10+ hrs every day.",5
12749,158,24 inch. Perfect for home computer.,5
12750,159,I have plugged in both my laptop (via hdmi) and desktop (via VGA) to the monitor and use them interchangeably on a daily basis. Works perfectly fine and the image quality is great especially when moved the settings to 75hz instead of default 60hz.,5
12751,160,"All good except for stand. The stand is so weird the monitor screen does not stands straight. It leans forward to quite good extent which makes entire experience of watching on screen really bad.

Rest all good. Screen quality reproduces good colors and nice experience while watching movies (I had keep some wooden sticks towards end of the stand so that screen does not lean forward)",2
12752,161,"Not gonna lie, this exceeded my expectations. Pretty much the best you could buy under 10K (I got it for 9400/- )

You could not tell the difference between 75Hz and 60Hz however when I do switch to my laptop which has a 60Hz display, after working on the monitor, I could feel some lag. So, smooth display on this monitor. It gets really bright too, I keep it at 15% only since anything above 30 is too bright for me.

Obviously not for eSports gaming, because of the response time and refresh rate.",5
12753,162,Good product,5
12754,163,,5
12755,164,Good Product with appreciate Price,5
12756,165,"The stand could be a little bit better. But, it is not a problem nevertheless. Everything else is just amazing and the best value-of-money product.

There is no height adjustment. ( and it should not be expected at this price). The tilt option is good enough and steady. I am a fast and hard typer and my table and/or monitor don't wobble.

I am planning to get another one for my multi-monitor setup.

I am using this with my Macbook Pro 2019 16inch. It is all good. AMD Freesync also works.

And it is made in Vietnam.",5
12757,166,Highly recommend product. Great quality. Of course you can not expect display quality of retina. But if you are looking for budget monitor go for it.,5
12758,167,Value for money. Easy for office use.,5
12759,168,"Color production very bad, white is not white, gray white. Other colors also bad quality.",1
12760,169,Does the job exactly as what it said. Monitor is good but I feel I should have ordered something with sound as well.,4
12761,170,"The pic quality is good, but there are two improvements required
- The stand of the monitor is fixed and tilted towards front.it could not be adjusted even by 1 degree.
-There is no audio port, which is a common feature in most of the monitors.

Although country of origin was written as India,it turned out to be imported from another country.",3
12762,171,"This product is a good deal. However, you'll notice where this product lacks pretty soon. There's bleeding over the edges. It has VESA mount support, so you can attach it to a monitor arm or wall, but the stand it comes with is not adjustable. It is good for regular use, doesn't strain the eyes much. The color accuracy seems good. If you have a specific use case, you might want a different monitor. Overall it's a good deal.",3
12763,172,"Excellent product. Though I am little sceptical whether it is IPS or not. Good colors, really bright for indoor, anti-glare. You will enjoy viewing it. My unit has a tiny black dot on the right side, I believe a foreign particle in between the layer. But I dont mind it. It does not have back light bleeding. Right side portion is little brighter than the left side if you are viewing black. Tilt mechanism is little weird. Otherwise really good product.",5
12764,173,"Very good and affordable monitor! Has various different modes like eye care, power save, game mode. There is slight bleeding expected around the edges, but it's not very bad, I think for this price you won't get a monitor with no bleed. And it's only noticeable if you're on a black screen.
Overall works very well and is definitely a very good upgrade for my 7 year old LG monitor.",5

12777,186,"Using this for one week. After searching many products, I found this to be the only one that is ""Manufactured in India (Indian Origin)"" and was well within by budget. It has HDMI and VGA support. Looks are very sleek. The only limitation is that it doesn't have built-in speakers like few others in this category however, you don't need this feature anyways in an external monitor :)",5
12778,187,Best for WFH setup.. The eye care is the best thing I liked. You won't like it in the first impression but on long run when you sit for 6-8 hours in front of screen this feels lot better. The only thing i miss is inbuilt speaker or audio output jack. but in the price range this ia the best.,5
12779,188,"Bad design of screen angle. By default it is tilted forward and tilt adjustment is also not available. Worst part is that both Amazon and Samsung refused to take a return. They say it's not defective or broken. For me a bad ergonomic design is a broken and defective product.

The screen design is NOT good for your back and eyes when using for long term.",2

But then I noticed a small internal scratch on the right side of the screen, in the middle. Smaller than my thumbnail. So then I looked for other faults and found a dead pixel.
These were not acceptable to me hence I returned it. Return was seamless, got my refund within a few hours of product pickup.",3
12781,190,"Great picture quality and clarity. Default setting of brightness is too high. Please adjust it as suitable to you when you start using the monitor. I connected it with VGA without any graphics card. Still gave crystal clear picture in 1080p. Result would be even better on HDMI.

I didnt see any noticable light leakage in the screen edges as some posts say. Probably its miniscule.",5
12797,206,Major issue with this product is that the screen does not title. In fact the stand which was supplied actually made the screen tilt slightly downwards and it was quite inconvenient. Finally had to buy a separate monitor stand.,3

Contacted Samsung customer care and they raised an installation request, however the installation company was going to charge 500 bucks for it! So ended up cancelling them. Now I have to live with this tilted monitor, really regretting buying this over the Benq one.

Other than this, display quality is good, I was not missing any screws in the box. The physical button at the back is not ideal to change display settings, my old Samsung monitor had a touch sensitive strip at the bottom right, which will remain my favourite way to change settings in a monitor.",1

12992,1,"The watch is great for the price. Most things work great. Has great battery life. As a dailywear, there's not much to worry about. It detects activity but that happens only after a considerable amount of time (20 minutes). One cannot change the activity detection sensitivity or time.

The watch is not very intuitive to use. It's usually great and most features can be accessed easily but certain things take more clicks and taps than should be required in a compact device. So all the features are there, but it takes a bit of time to find them.
Sleep tracking is decent.

Phone calls have good quality. People can hear your voice even if there is reasonable disturbance. If you answered through your phone and now want to switch to your watch, you cannot do that. And you can only save at most 10 contacts. You cannot dial numbers. But the mic and speaker of the watch is good

Also, a confusing thing is, why does the watch not have audio alarms, when it is capable of producing sound?",4
12993,2,"good one i got this 1399 ... i write this review after 2 month usage .. battery is awesome if u not connected with phone it gives 10 days while connected in phone it battery life become 4 or 5 days .. if u need accurate calculate your heart beat ,walk pls go with another its worthy but not accurate , calling function and u can speak through connected with your phone dont expect high quality in call but its not bad it become average it has 150 plus watch faces and you can customise with your photos . mainly some time its failed with you connect with mobile ,i mainly facing this issue , and but at this price it's value for money budget friendly watch i will suggest for budget buys with bluetooth caling future ...",4
12994,3,"Giving review after a month:
The watch is working perfectly fine, the only issue which I face is the battery glitch, sometimes the battery level remains same for a day while sometimes it decreaes by around 10-15% in a hour, but is a software glitch. I hope Noise will make it correct by software updates.
Thanks",4
12995,4,"I have tried BOAT and FIREBOLT also and found this as the best so returned the other two.
I will discuss the pros and cons but before that I must say that the accuracy of readings are pathetic especially sleep monitoring .
All the smartwatches in the market at this price range doesn't give accurate results as smartbands... I am disappointed with that .. but why I finally chose to keep the Noise buzz and return boat wave lite and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ----

Pros
1. Good battery life , better than FIREBOLT ninja which was about 2 days.. Noise gives almost 3 to 4 days battery life with normal usage.
2. Calling is quite good quality ( FIREBOLT was also good )
3. The settings of DND , SMART DND, SILENT , VIBRATION is better.
4. Vibration is good and really wakes u up unlike the other watches where vibration can't be adjusted and doesn't wake you up.. here vibration can be adjusted if you want more or less amount.

Cons
1. Pathetic accuracy. Don't take this watch if you are only looking for sleep monitoring , heart beat etc. It's better to buy a good smartband for that.
2. Interface is not the best but it's okay

I bought this calling watch for 1700 in the great Indian festival and I feel at this price range it was the best as I have used Boat wave lite(non calling watch at 1200) and FIREBOLT ninja call pro ( 1800rs ) .I finally decided to keep the Noise and return the rest.",4
12996,5,"After 1 month of use I feel this wat h is value for money as it provide calling under 2k

pros -
1. Easy to use and easy to connect.
2. Accurate data analysied.
3. Never disconnect in calls, just one tap connect.
4. Basic interference to use.
5. Bluetooth is good.
6. yes this is waterproof, went in shower with this on nothing happen but dont over do it.
7. Good watch faces could add more.

cons -
1. Battery life - yes, everyone talking that battery is good, though it is good but was expecting better battery life. with call features on max 2 days it can restarin.
2. Could add a ringtone ! my personal choice.
3. wrist awake feature is not good.

conclusion - This watch is good in this price but not best in class. If you can spend more you will get better watch this.",4

13048,57,"The quality of the watch is good and the design is also good.
I have used it for a month now and I have no issues with it.
I liked the design as it is very simple and it is very lightweight, hence you don't feel it while wearing it.
The build quality of the product is good and it has good battery life.
The battery life is better than the other watches in this price range and the built quality is good.

Good battery life, better than FIREBOLT ninja which was about 2 days... Noise gives almost 3 to 4 days of battery life with normal usage.
The calling is quite good quality ( FIREBOLT was also good )

13056,65,"Bought this at 1699 and was ok with thebfeatires and price but found more advanced features at se
Or lesser price from other brands. Still a good deal.
Missing features at same price point are
1. Voice asst
2. Calculator
3. Games
4. Bp

Notifications stay like messages and have to be deleted like messages once in watch and again in phone.
Bluetooth calling is more like a tws earphone a separate function, but cannot play music or other streaming other than phone calls. Not even whatsapp calls. Practically nothing more than a show off. Wrist turn awake to show time is a good feature especially with disable feature at night but it takes a second to turn on which is slow.
Auto detection of workouts did show up after 5 mins of walking but never recorded anything. Reminders are not repeatable. Alarms cannot be named. Watch faces are not impressive.

Strap is plugbin type and notnpin type so is proprietary and not generic pin type.

Unable to return it for better deals even if not happy with features/performance",4

Battery - Last for 5 days without connectivity and last for 2.5 days with connectivity. Drains fastee after it gets below 30%.

Accuracy - All the details are accurate 95% but prefer to use porper medical grade instruments to check. Dont depend on tge watch

Modes - All the modes are good.

Bluetooth Calling - Calling is best. At this price point but there are some drowbacks like it takes time to notify the caller details, battery drains very fast, it can be helful to merge call to your Bluetooth earphones.

Quality - Straps quality are good, but not as Sturdy for rough job. Screen if not for rough usage. It gets scratches often.
(If possible order screen cover or guard)

Value for Money - If this watch is available for ‚Çπ1350 around then you should buy it definitely. But ita not worth of money if you spend more than ‚Çπ1500.",4

Main gripe is that it should do better in step counting. The current deviation is about -20% from actual.

Said in a line.... would be best if software was fixed. If Noise is reading this, then, here's an attempt to listing them -

1. Step counting to be fixed
2. Automatic Sport detection doesn't work
3. Improved Sport menu needed - for eg. Walking is under Running Sports. Badminton is not found under Indoor sports, instead under Ball sports,. When choosing badminton, there's no option to simply start activity - instead, there are 3 more steps to set targets, type of activity and then start.

Major Issues : Health Hazards - It may explode , Bluetooth, pedometer, it detects heart beat of chairs and almost everything which is having a reflecting surface.

1. No Customer Care number or email, You have to Riase Tickets and average time for a single reply which could be bogus reply takes 12-15 Days as per there description while raising tickets.

2. Every device can have glitches, bugs but for resolving these issues software updates are released by OEMs but Noise dont have anything like that.

3. Bluetooth range is very less and you can't check if you have been a watch which is having Bluetooth 4.1 or 5.3 anywhere.

4. It uses Audio/Music Option for find my device option which is usually muted or put on low volume so you cant locate your phone as the alert tone will either be silent or at very low volume as you may have set while listening to your music or while watching YouTube.

5. You can't use Watch as music player on watch, it plays music on phone- the speaker on watch are for just calling purpose.

6. The watch has only vibrate option for alerts on watch itself, ringtone doesn't work.

7. The watch faces are limited and mostly very bad , you cant set your personal photos as wallpaper or as watch faces.

8. No Customer Support, no improvement based on reviews or suggestions or feedbacks as per customers.

9. watch doesn't charge more than 98%, i.e. it stucks there, assuming the quality of service it may blast ( Health hazards)

10. Pedometer doesn't work.

11. It detects heart beat of chairs, handkerchief and also shows heart beat of 110 and 115.

12. It doesn't detect sleep properly

13. You can add only 5 Contacts in app and can call only these numbers",1

Value for money - for ppl who don't bother about charging the watch every 2 days. This is a value for money.

14688,1697,This watch is very good its touch response is very good .I use this watch from last one month it is best but there is two demerit that the watch screen size is small according to 1.69 and second one is the strap of this replaceable but this kind of strap is very difficult to find,5

14692,1,"The watch is extremely affordable as it just cost me Rs. 1999. The watch's strap is of a pretty good quality and makes you feel comfortable when worn. The watch's capsule is made up of pure stainless steel. Whenever someone looks at the watch, they aren't able to tell that it only cost me 2K bucks, as the display of the watch, gives an expensive vibe. But, the screen of the watch hasn't covered the whole glass (as shown on the cover of the box of the watch). Pixels of the watch could have been improved & they could have added one or two more games too! Spo2, Heart Rate, steps, weather & sleep tracker are quite accurate, would have rated it a 5/5 if they wouldn't have had done fake marketing of the product. But, if you have a budget of 2000 in your mind, then this watch has been designed for you, my friend!",4
14693,2,"You can not select extra apps except pre downloaded apps for notification access.
Sleep tracking is not special. The feel is really good. You can use it for 3 to 5 days in a single full charge. There are more than 100 sports mode but none of them is specific. They just claculate your heart rate and time. I will give it 3.5",4
14694,3,"Defiantly value for money!
It is working fine, sensors are not that accurate ( decent ), Almost No Lag in UI, Speaker and mic are also decent (loud and clear).
Battery Life - With Bluetooth always on for 2 Days (Moderate Use) & Bluetooth off for 7 Days. I only turn on Bluetooth when I am travelling.
3rd party Da-Fit app is the only disappointing factor.
I will recommend this watch if you are looking for a round dial smartwatch under 2,000.",4

But it has some flaws too.
Likewise sleep tracking it doesn't seems to work that properly, it doesn't measured my sleep time. Moreover it gets connected automatically even if it isn't paired.

But all the other functions are good.
I would give it 8/10",4
14699,8,I would call it a perfect health tracker.. Being an Dr I would like to recommend this as a good option to gift ur loved ones whom you r too much concerned abt their health.,4

14702,11,"First thing is that for the price it's a ""fairly good watch"" i would give it an easy 3.8‚≠ê.
The problem's that I faced using this watch is that the battery of this watch is not really that great, you get a maximum of 3 days and a few hours of battery life. Mind you that I have disabled everything, including the vibration, phone and the brightness reduced to nearly 10%. So if you want a better battery, don't take this. And second is that since this one has a call feature, it has a really annoying and very loud tune that rings when someone calls you and there is no option of muting that ring or any sorts. The rest, like I said 3.8‚≠ê",4
14703,12,Just started using fire boltt phoenix. Great performance with good battery life. It goes upto 12 hrs in single charging with heavy use. Like the camera shutter. You can click photos directly from the watch in single click. Sleep tracking is also good.,4

14706,15,It is overall a good product. The calling quality and speaker quality is good in this budget. It goes 2 days in one go after charging. Slight issue with the button and the screen doesn't lit up when I turn my wrist. Overall it's a good product.,4
14707,16,Excellent Watch in the budget segment. Everything is good but one con's is battery backup is not good as I expected. Draining rapidly.,4
14708,17,"Changing my review to 4Stars as the defective unit was replaced after raising a complaint online. Regarding the product, it looks and feels nice. The only con I find is that the bluetooth calling distance -- it does not work even if your phone is just in the next room.

In just 2 weeks the screen blurred up and distorted. Don't waste your money. I am trying to get it replaced but no response.",4
14709,18,At price under 2k... Metal body... Bluetooth calling and most of the smart watch features... The round dial is just a class design...screen quality is good... Best for everyday use,4
14710,19,The watch looks very good and is very easy to operate. The body of the frame is metallic which makes the watch a bit heavy but the quality is very nice. There are few coupons also available in the box which you can redeem and get exciting offers.,4
14711,20,I have been using it for a month. Really stylish and its metal body gives a premium look. it's worth for the money,4
14712,21,Just received the product today. At first glance looks good and promising.But yet to explore all of its features. I will update the review after few weeks of use.,4
14713,22,"Writing this review after gifting if to my brother and using for 1 hour. Watch touch screen is awesome, no lag and smooth running. Charging is quite fast. 20 minutes and 20-60% charge. Watch is good looking too. I haven't test the sleep tracking yet. But my bro will surely tell the sleep tracking experience and I'll edit this review. The only bad (actually worst) thing about this watch is that the sensors are fully fake. I tested it on a table and it shows that the table has 78 bpm. If you wear it you will also get the same result. Watch is quite good, you could go for it if you are not looking for a heart beat, SpO2 sensing watch because they are worst.",4

 I am writing this detailed review after using this product for a week:

Build Quality: It is metal body but not the pure metal material, overall build quality is good.

Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.

Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.

Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full charge",4
14715,24,I received this product 1 month ago and i will get best product from fire boltt there is no issue in porduct,4
14716,25,"It's value for money, I bought it in 1999. I have been using it for the last 3 days and it seems to be working fine.

Call Feature: 4/5, Good connectivity, clear voice

‚Ä¢ Look is good.
‚Ä¢ Smooth experience
‚Ä¢ Battery backup is also acceptable. (Using from 3 days)
‚Ä¢ Sleep tracking is decent.

Overall it's good in this price range.",4
14717,26,"The overall product is good and very well designed there is every features which is important there is no issue related to its feature and the design of the product was just amazing,slim and very good looking .I faced the issue with it's side button there is not a quick response the button work slow compare to other watch brands",4
14718,27, Touch is smooth.. belt is soft so it's very comfortable while wearing it for a long time... Affordable Smart Watch in this range with such good features.. calling option is available so one can call using the dail and also pick up the call the voice will come from the watch it self as it has speaker and a mic.. you can sync the contacts also various notification options are available. Overall a great product in this price range.. Quality is superb..,4
14719,28,purchased just a few weeks ago and the screen is not working properly . Certain lines are coming on the screen,4
14720,29,After 3month i am seeing a line in centre. It's ok product to see just time. Silicone belt is itchy not good quality.,4
14721,30,"I will recommend that buy the watch in sale when the price drop to ‚Çπ1899.
Rest the review is below. (I hope it helps).

Pros.....
1) Look is premium. (10/10)
2) Smooth experience. (9/10)
3) Battery backup is also decent. (8/10)
4) Raise to wake is a responsive (8/10)
5) Sleep tracking is decent. (8/10)

Cons...
6) There are a lot of watch faces in dafit app but half of it is boaring (6/10)

7) Do not have option to silent the calls and also the volume of ringtone can't be decreased (feature is available but do not work). (1/10)

8) The biggest problem that I have faced is that the watch is automatically connected to other device if they have dafit.(My watch was connected to random phones two time) and then they can easily change everything on your watch. In other smartwatch first we have to reset the watch to connect to other device üòëüòë.

9) Only vibration for alarm, no sound even after having good speaker. (2/10)

The watch's capsule is made up of pure stainless steel. Whenever someone looks at the watch, they aren't able to tell that it only cost me 2K bucks, as the display of the watch, gives an expensive vibe.

The brightness is also enough and visible in direct sunlight.
Also in such a low price segment we get bluetooth calling, song playing feature, call dialing and contact saving features and these work really well. Also to mention the speakers are loud enough and have very less distortion on 100% volume.
The quality of dial and belt is also nice, where we get metal frame in 2k!

15135,444,"First thing is that for the price it's a ""fairly good watch"" i would give it an easy
The problem's that I faced using this watch is that the battery of this watch is not really that great, you get a maximum of 3 days and a few hours of battery life. Mind you that I have disabled everything, including the vibration, phone and the brightness reduced to nearly 10%. So if you want a better battery, don't take this. And second is that since this one has a call feature, it has a really annoying and very loud tune that rings when someone calls you and there is no option of muting that ring or any sorts.",5

15145,454,I like It so much This watch is so awesome and so many futures in there and 2 games I got this watch only in 2000 üòä.oo this is so primium. üëå,4
15146,455,A very gud watch in this price range..all the features work so well..just a single con is its battery backup with calling facility is only a single day..that is the only con i am facing while using it for 15days ..,4
15147,456,Nice product...,4
15148,457,"Some functionalities are not implemented properly like if we switch to audio my phone whole audio will be transferred to watch and there no simple option to set the watch as silent if we are ineeting or so, but it is one of the best in good features and good looking watch in this price range",4
15149,458,The product is good and in this product I really like the design of the product.the squre shape of the product is and that shape is covered with metal body.,4
15150,459,"I am using the watch since 2 days. I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed. I am not able to add personalized wallpaper as well, I doesn't like the watch faces except a few of them. Regarding the battery life, I have changed it only once and it still has 85-90% of charge left. All the sensor seem to be working pretty good and almost accurate. There are no lagging issues. The touch response is were good. Speaker is very loud. Except the wallpapers all other features are good for this price range.",4
15151,460,Watch is excellent in this price point... Look stylish..... futures are good .. calling feature is good sound mike everything works perfect...overall good watch in budget,4
15152,461,"Design,and built quality is excellent. Beautiful watch in this price range.Touch screen, Voice is clear, Mic is also good. And all other features are good.
Good battery life minimum 4 to 5 days while using theatre mode or battary save mood. And Bluetooth calling mood 3 to 4 days working.
Customizable watch faces are missing, No watch face storage option, always download and apply.
there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be changed.",4
15153,462,"Good looking watch, it would be far more better product if we can change more than one default watchfaces to our favorite watchfaces. It would be much better if it had a calculator. But at last it is a good product",4
15154,463,"All fine as expected but there is a problem in company marketing, actually in every photo they patched a bazel less watch photo but in real life it has a thick black bazel outside, so it seems like a scam to the customers and gimmick both, I highly request to the Fireboult team so that they don't use such fake stuffs to exaggerate in their advertisement pic an d video too.ü§¨",4
15155,464,"The smoothness of the UI in the watch is great and looks premium

But the there should be more watch faces and customize option for user",4
15156,465,"The watch is really good, the accuracy part is quite nice but I have to connect 2 bluetooth devices at the same time to enable calling and when the calling one in connected, other sounds are also coming from watch only. Please work on that, otherwise it‚Äôs a great product.",4
15157,466,"Touch is not much good, display size can be improved it's a good product in budget. Don't expect too much from this product because in this price range you will get Bluetooth calling, SPO2, SLEEP TRACKING, etc in this watch. In this price range you can go for this watch to try it. The touch is good not seeing delay when it touch and yes it's a good product not wow but yes affordable. Built quality is ok and watch strap is good.",4
15158,467," Using last 20 days and it's easy to use.
My friends also ask about this watch because it's looks premium watch segment.
Happy with purchase
Most of people suffering with call loudness and need vibrate mode.
So check the video and do accordingly.
First go Blutooth option and click the connected fire bollt watch then go and setting of the watch and off the phone call option as per image attached.
then go toto watch setting in shown in video and off the phone option.
Then u r watch will vibrate without erreted the loudness of calls.",4
15159,468,"Good product
Nice calling feature
Tracking is also good
The only prblm is that it has poor watch faces hope this might be updated by fire boltt soon",4
15160,469,"Well.. I guess u should hope for much at this price point, but still it's good enough for giving u an idea about the actual data.. Like it's not 100% accurate but yeah.. It's okeish.. ‚úå",4

It is very economical and in budget watch having numerous features.Need to improve in battery backup thing.

Other than that no problem with it",4

15164,473,"So I bought this watch, Phoenix, about a month & a half ago so far it's actually working pretty good. The sensors for heart rate & SPO2 is really acurate, and also tracking accuracy for exercises is really good. And also the calling quality is crystal clear and mic quality is also good from what I have heard from the other end. So far so good, let's see for how long can it hold up.",4
15165,474,Watch is good according to price. You can say value of money. Touch screen accuracy is quite good but sometime sliding issue raises,4
15166,475,Great,4
15167,476,"Awesome product, does not betray at any point, also has motion sensors meaning when you move up your hand to see the time the screen automatically lights up which is a really cool and amazing feature not found in other watches of this range. Watch is good as compared to money. Touch is good and according to functions value for money. Personally i found its bit heavy as compared to my another smart watch. Also using third party app for all functioning and allow permissions to access data, is not looks good interms of data security. Absolutely loved this and highly recommend this.",4
15168,477,I have found the the watch is good but there are some big flaws in the watch. The biggest of them is there is no silent option for call. When a call or notification comes it rings very loudly and it cannot be vibret .The battery life is more or less 5 to 6 days. After all these this is a good watch that's why I gave it 4 stars.,4
15169,478,I have bought this Fire-Boltt model and i am very happy as such i am sport player it helps me in tracking my heart beat count as well as the stress level on matches.,4

- Charge dropped from 100% to 11% in 12hrs with no calls and no vibration setting and with low brightness

Hoping the replacement behaves better ...Fingers crossed",3

Display - nice and crisp colours. Sunlight view is also good average type.
Sensors - HR and SpO2 sensors give results on soft surface but give error msg on hard surface and air.
UI is butter smooth and fantastic. Brightness is quite good.
Battery - gives 4 5 days without phone call and with phone call it gives in total of 30mins call time(6 7 normal calls)
Games are nice and fun to play.
Alarm can't be set from watch.
call Ringer can't be silenced it will ring all the time but we can disconnect calling feature from watch itself.
Mic and speaker quality is average and fine.

Screen: Amazing experience with screen, even it is not Amoled display but you will not feel the need as brightness is sufficient when wants to use in Sunlight. Touch is very smooth but you will get scratches on screen easily. Wakeup function was not working initially but worked pretty well after resetting.

Accuracy: Most of the Smartwatches measure ghost reading so this does but overall accuracy is good in this budget.

Battery: The average battery back up is 6-7days, the battery backup will be 2-3 days if you are using calling function moderately. It takes 1.5 hour to full charge",5

16191,0,"[Update: Sept 29] boAt seems to have heard the feedback üòÄ and updated the watch faces. Now there are a few good ones to pick but a slight improvement over the ones the watch earlier had. Bit Impressed. Added one star for it.

Not a very polished product. The fonts are tacky and look ugly in the watch for notification text and caller name text. The watch faces are a lazy design job. No point having 150 watch faces if only 10-20 are good or usable. Rest are useless.
[UPDATE: Oct 11] boAt seems to be on a smartwatch launch spree. And thanks to that, they are constantly updating the phone app and the watch faces. Now you have many good looking watch faces to choose from. So overall, still the Smartwatch UI needs work. But atleast you have good watch faces.

Good:
- Screen quality
- Battery life
- Looks and the metallic frame
- Call clarity
- BT calling at the price
- Reasonably accurate sensors

Bad:
- The UI, fonts - they are all very ugly and tacky. They could have tried to give the Chinese software some makeover. But it is a clearly lazy job by the tech team. A copy paste job to be precise of getting an outsourced software and plastering it with brand logos.
- Restarts randomly when the call is going on on the watch even for 1 min or so.
- Watch faces. Again a job of the design / tech / UI team. BoAt doesn't have a good team of designers and UI guys to really offer simple yet good software features like good watch faces and good watch UI.
- No option to silence a call or reply with quick replies.

Look for Noise Smart Watches in the Same Range. Noise Colorfit Pulse Go Buzz is cheaper and better alternative + has better watch faces and UI and quick reply to notifications and call silence and mute options for lower prices which this watch has clearly missed.

You can go for boAt Wave Call also - It isn't an outright bad watch, but there are better options available for the price.

boAt - If you have a team who reads and wants to improve, get some good UI and design folks in your team. Your products are good, but the UI and design is what the people see and that's what makes them feel good about your products. You have really average UI.",4
16192,1,Ok good call volume is good app is not working properly every time aad watch in mobile app is problem,4

16194,3,"boat offer balance products though it is audio or watch catagory.

boat has best smartwatch under reasonble price.
i want to add one thing, why do we buy a calling smartwatch if we have mobile and headphone or tws., its not worth it for only calling.

pros
1. design and shape.

cons
1.calling is average and annoying.",4

The step counter is pretty accurate and the heart rate and spo2 sensors work great (have compared with actual spo2 device and the results are consistent). I have not charged it till now after using it for a couple of days so I would say battery backup is also decent. The build quality also feels premium.

The heart rate sensor is accurate as expected. The build quality seems good and perfectly fitted to my hand. The UI is simple to use. Music controlling, Spo2 and so many sports modes are working fine. The battery backup given is 10 days, a good thing while travelling.

 Prebooked and got the product with in 48 hrs. Initial impressions are:
Product is looking good and Features accuracy is also great.
Got an in build speaker which is very loud you can easily use it.
Speaker Quality is also nice
Display is really bright, you can use it bright sun light too.
Got some good features too.
watch can be disconnected from call feature too.
but cons are:
1. There is an issue with app may be which is causing the faces change automatically.
2. Watch faces provided were terrible (in my opinion)
3. Touch sensitivity while dialing is a bit hard you need to maintain your accuracy here
4. 10 Contacts can only be saved.

 Very good product at this price range.. writing the review after using it almost a month.
everything is working very nicely.. calling function is my favorite.. you can receive or dial a call with this and also talk without touching your phone with it's built in mic and speaker. You can also play music through it's inbuilt speaker and its very loud and clear.
Only minus point of this watch is it's raise to wake function, it doesn't wake so many times by raising your hand and we have to press the button of the watch to see the screen.

This watch has an ultra-slim body which is light in weight and gives a premium look. The seamless body and build quality are fantastic. The display on this smartwatch is amazing, and it works well both indoors and outdoors.

Talking about its features, the call feature works decently and the mic and speaker quality is enhanced. Other features such as heart rate, blood oxygen level, and sleep monitor are also properly functioning. However, as they say in the description, this is not a medical grade smart watch. However, it is almost accurate in heart rate and spo2.

Another thing that makes it so impressive is its battery life. It lasts up to 8-10 days without Bluetooth and up to 2-3 days with Bluetooth enabled.

It was a surprise to see the quality of BT's calls. BT Calling stands out for its price. This product is truly amazing.

Note: There are different varients in CX-405 model this I came to know while discussing with Sony Tech support. This model does not have 60i / 60p frame rate.

I taught it will have FH option and tried it with SanDisk Xtream (64 GB) Class 10 micro SD and It did not show up the FH 60i / 60p options.

Hope this review is helpful and one more thing it has only 1 year warranty not two years as advertised.

This product is manufactured in China.Got the free bag with original packaging and accessories.

16694,3,Nice. But the plastic quality of this handycam shoule be more improved.,4
16695,4,"The display screen of the camcorder is too small, so the user gets only a vague idea of the environment while viewing through the LCD. Also, if we increase the zoom beyond a particular level, the quality of the picture reduces accordingly. And, there is no Memory Card and Carry Case in the packed box I have received, a similar experience to my recent purchase of the Canon EOS M200 Camera from Amazon, where there was no memory card and carry case in that box also !!",3

16699,8,"Purchased this camcorder with trust in Sony brand. But the experience was very bad. First I received an old/used camera with scratch marks and faded paint. Asked for a replacement which was sent by Amazon. Again faced the similar experience. This time the camera was looking new but failed to turn ON. The Sony box which contains the camera looked brand new with a proper seal but on closer examination it created doubt about the seal. The seal on the box looked like it wasn't sealed in factory. Not expected from either Sony or Amazon. If you are selling recycled/refurbished products or repacking it outside factory please mention that it is a refurbished product and not a new. Moreover before dispatching to customer please check the condition of products that you are selling.

Finally purchased this camera from the famous ""camera gully"" in Mumbai at a very discounted price.",1
16700,9,"Recently I bought the Sony hdr cx 405 and i am really satisfied with the picture quality, to me it is nearly or identical with the higher range biger camcorder out there, coz.

16710,19,This is a handy product for outdoors. For indoor use I do not recommend this. If you know to take photos in a dslr then probably you will not like the video quality. Low light videos are absolutely grainy because of ISO management. But all in all iknda okay.,3
16711,20,Did not recive cover and SD card as mention while purchasing,2
16712,21,"Pros:
- Very easy to use
- Battery Life is good, around 1 hour 15 minutes of Recording (which is a lot for casual use)
- Manual controls are there if required
- Compact and lightweight
- GREAT optical stabilization (better than any smartphone)
- Absolutely no complaints about video and audio quality. It will not be DSLR like, but this is not a professional camera. Its primary use is to quickly capture moments of time which you can cherish forever.

Cons:
- Manual controls are very cumbersome to use
- Camera turns off if you close the screen module
- Interface to playback the recorded videos is slow and complex. Better just copy the files to your PC and watch.

Other things to note:
- Good quality videos (1080p50) take a lot of storage space. Get atleast 64GB card for this.
Also make sure you have enough space on your hard drives because they will be filling fast if you shoot regularly.
(Though you can save a lot of space by converting the videos to a lower bit rate at the cost of video quality and your CPU's time)
- It doesn't have a microphone input.

Bonus:
Seller 'Appario Retails' was generous enough to provide me a carrying case and an extra battery free of cost. Thanks a lot!",5

I am professional photographer and i choose dslr over camcorder for professional shoots but this camcorder is must have if you have new born baby at home . So much easy to use special for grandma and baby‚Äôs mom . Full HD is bit noise during the night or low light situation. That because of sensor size .

16920,229,"Decent little camera, not for me though, I require Clean HDMI out and this camera simply does not have that function. It‚Äôs a newer camera so I thought it would, turns out my old canon from 2013 does and I‚Äôve had to swap back to it",3
16921,230,"I've given this five stars because I really do think this is a dandy little camera, but it wasn't the right purchase for me, and I gave it away to a friend for an early Christmas present. I think you should know:

1. This is a very small camera. It is not the size of a Coke can, think more the size of a little V-8 can. It is entirely plastic and it weighs practically nothing at all. Really, it weighs less than my television remote. That can be good or bad. You can shove it into the pocket of a jacket and forget you are even carrying it, so it's always with you. Like a TV remote, you can probably drop it without damaging it because it has so little mass. But, if you have unusually large hands, like mine, or arthritis, like me, or your hands have become insensitive through age or manual labor, also like mine, you may have trouble picking it up or holding onto it. I can only get three fingers of my hand through the strap up to the middle knuckle, and that is with the strap adjusted all the way out, as loose as it will go. The menu button, a four-way rocker with an ""enter"" or ""OK"" button in the center is about the diameter of a garden pea. Not only will my big thumbs not operate this button, but the switch that changes from ""video"" to ""playback"" is directly below the rocker switch, and my thumb covers them both and I end up pushing both at the same time. If you leave this sitting on a restaurant table, you may not even notice that it is no longer in your pocket, because it only weighs a few ounces.

2. If I am reading the display correctly, a 64GB micro SD will hold 7+ hours worth of video. The batteries last about 2 hours and a dead flat battery will take the better part of 3 hours to recharge. Get the Powerextra 2 pack replacement Sony NP-BX1, also sold on Amazon. It has two extra batteries, and a charger that you can charge from a wall socket or from a car 12v outlet. I can testify that it charges faster than the wall charger that comes with the camera, and if you are at an all day event you will need those extra batteries.

This is a very nice camcorder. It has an excellent lens, the digital zoom is just spectacular. It will take still pictures as well, even while you are making a video. I gave it to a gal who is very small, has small hands, and can text on a mini keyboard cell phone with both thumbs. She navigates menus within menus like it was second nature. She loves it. It just wasn't made for a fella like me.",5
16922,231,"Couldn't find out if it could handle a 256GB SDXC card so, I took a chance & bought one anyway. At 1920x1080 60fps I now have 10Hr 47min recording time. Great for cramming everything on one card. Not super great in low light. Otherwise, excellent imaging. Love the tiny size of this. Light as dust bunny. Nice to have a Zeiss. My general opinion is that for the money, you can't find anything better. I understand some uninspired people lacking the intuitive power, or patience to understand how to operate it. I was a little intimidated by the menu navigation at first. But practice makes perfect.",5
16923,232,"I use this at church with a video switcher. It has a clean HDMI output. The only thing I don't like is you have to unplug the HDMI cable and close the LCD monitor to turn the power off. A Canon camera that I also use has a power button. You can't close the monitor without unplugging the cable. Well, I tried removing the battery and just running it off the AC adapter. That does, indeed, allow you to turn it off, but you can't turn it back on without closing the LCD monitor and opening it again. But other than that, it's great for my use.",5
16924,233,"I bought this used and the company had a great review so I took a chance! It was well worth it. I used to do TV shows with my students and I have lots of older Hi8 and MiniDV cameras. I miss those camera days and the reviews on this cam on YouTube are great! Checkout MarkusPix reviews of it. He obviously is a camera expert. This cam is so light at first it seems like a toy, but don‚Äôt be fooled. It is so light weight it‚Äôs great for travel. It has a Carl Zeiss lens and optical zoom 30X. Sure it has the mini micro cards and no sound input but it has great sound and you can buy inexpensive recorders and lavaliers you can carry in your pocket. I bought a Zoom H1n recorder ($70) and a JJC Wired Remote Shooting Grip ($40) so I can hold it steadier. It zooms in and remotely works controls. This cam came out in 2015 and you can still get it new for $228! If you do, buy the insurance. The whole setup is so small you can fit it in your purse or small bag. Even though I use my iPhone on a gimbal I love the 30X zoom and how smooth the zoom is. Plus I‚Äôm not eating up my phone‚Äôs memory. This is a great addition to a travel kit!",5
16925,234,"I needed a camera for my streaming/zoom set up. I found a Sony Cx405 used in like new condition for $140 so I got one to try out. I also bought a Canon R800 as well from Canon's refurb store for $165. Having the two side by side really helps.

First, they are almost the same size, but the Canon looks and feel a bit sturdier. Both are very light weight but the Canon feels like less of a toy. Both have clean HDMI out. The Canon uses mini HDMI, the Sony uses Micro HDMI. The Canon has a microphone input, the Sony doesn't.

In use the first thing I noticed was that the Canon has an on/off switch. The Sony turns on when the screen flips open. The Canon can run plugged in without the battery, the Sony has to have a battery in order to turn on even if the power is plugged in. If your battery is low, the Sony gives an error message saying it cannot record and charge at the same time. The LCD screen on the Canon is vastly better. It's touch screen and is much higher quality. The viewing angle is much wider on the Canon. The Sony uses a joystick.

In terms of picture quality in good light, they are similar. The Canon has a bit warmer color tone. The Canon is miles better than the Sony in anything less than perfect lighting. The Canon autofocus is so much better. The Sony some time hunt and often falls asleep. I'd have to wave my hands in from of the lens to wake up the autofocus. In too bright or low light, the Sony autofocus is helpless. One thing the Sony has over the Canon is its lens is wider at the widest setting.

I must admit, my use of these 2 camcorders is atypical. I only use it for streaming. Even with a perfect lighting setup, the Canon is so much better in every single way that I bought 2 more Canons. At $139 for my used Sony I'll find a use for it. But I highly highly recommend the Canon over the Sony.",3
16926,235,"My application uses two HDMI cameras to feed a live video switcher (Cerevo Livewedge). I purchased both the Cannon HF R700 and the Sony HDCRX 405 to compare and evaluate. I ended up returning the Sony and getting a second Cannon HF R700 instead. The Cannon is a bit more expensive, but slightly better built and better matched to my application. If you are using the camera as a normal portable Camcorder, the Sony is a bit less expensive and would probably work for you. See below for details.

While both the Sony and the Cannon can be operated to produce a live feed via the HDMI output port, there are numerous advantages to the Cannon. First, the Cannon can be operated without the battery being present using the supplied AC adapter. The Sony can be powered via an extension USB cable plugged into the supplied USB brink, but the battery must always be present. In my environment I wanted to be able to just turn the power on and off using a plug strip that turns all the video equipment on and off. When the power to the Sony was turned off, the camera continued to run on battery power. To turn it off you needed to unplug the HDMI cable and close the fold out screen. There is no power switch on the Sony.

Second, the Sony micro HDMI connector on the camera was very flimsy. If I moved the camera slightly with the HDMI cable connected, the video would often drop out and come back as the cable was wiggled.

Finally the Sony has a slightly inferior picture quality when compared to the Cannon. This is more noticeable in low light conditions. (Nether camera does very well in low light, but the Sony does have a bit more noise.)

The Sony does have one advantage. It has an optical zoom of 60x, whereas the Cannon optical zoom is only 32x. When zoomed all the way in the Sony is slightly closer to the subject and when zoomed all the way out it has a somewhat wider field of view. This may be an important advantage for some users.

Both cameras have the ability to turn off any automatic power saving (so you can keep it running when on external power). Both have the ability to turn off the on-scree-display for the HDMI output port, but the Sony hides this feature by calling it ""HDMI Control"" instead of the obvious ""On-Screen-Display"".

The Cannon is slightly heavier and feels a bit more substantial. Both cameras have reasonable optical image stabilization, though when zoomed all the way in, neither is quite up to the task.",4
16927,236,"La r√©solution de l‚Äôimage, la dur√©e d‚Äôenregistrement et le format MP4 ¬´ direct ¬ª fait le travail pour filmer du sport d‚Äôune position statique.",4
16928,237,"No, it's not a 4K action cam. That being said, it does 1080p wonderfully. Zoom and image stabilization are great from my use, although I usually use a tripod. This is my second Sony - HDRCX405 HD. I still use the first one, when I needed a second camera for my YouTube videos I knew I was going to get another Sony - HDRCX405 HD. My first one has been knocked over on the tripod several times, knocked off my work bench, it even slid off the hood of my pickup a couple times and still works just fine. As long as you don't need 4K I'd recommend this camera.",5
16929,238,"Needed something to record a sports team for their reviews. This camera exceeded my expectations. Very simple, absolutely no bells and whistles but great zoom and great image quality. Everything we needed for a great price.",5
16930,239,"After years of using a video tape camera and transferring to dvds, then transferring that data to a hard drive, I made the switch to a digital camera. This model is small, easy to carry and easy to use, produces surprisingly high quality video. The video is then downloaded into your computer using Sony software, it is all much easier and much better than I imagined. I'm just an amateur home movie guy, and I wish I had done this a long time ago!",5
16931,240,"Play Video
 Very good for what I needed (a light camcorder for the car POV). This camcorder has a few quirks, but it is pretty good. See my video for details.",4
16932,241,"The video quality is good and I like the special video effects that come with the camera (retro, popping color, black and white, low color (a type of black and white)). The files seem really big, but I guess I need to change the settings to a lower quality. It doesn't matter because they are easily turned into smaller files via youtube or when using video editing software.

The video quality is good. In low light it does occasionally blur. I mean its a good camera, but definitely not the best. The main thing is it does shoot in high def. The picture quality is crystal clear and has cool special effects (like film things with popping color or the retor 80s camera look).

The one problem with this camera is that the microphone picks up background noise really bad. Like I'm recording and the background noise is not bad but when I play back the video like a car driving by outside is really loud or a fan being on in the room, it picks it up really loud. The sound quality is good other than that issue. This is a decent mid- price range camera but if you want to do some serious recording you probably need to upgrade to a more expensive one that has a better microphone or where you can plug in an external mic.

I have watch same great rock videos shot with sony cameras. The sound quality is excellent, but I think they are in a little higher price range. So I mean you are getting what you pay for with a mid price range camera here, but I do think Sony makes some of the best camcorders.",4
16933,242,"This camera is replacing a Sony HDR-SR10 from 2008. For your consideration, this older model is bigger and much much heavier (though not heavy) and was about $1500 in 2008. It is NOT a fair comparison - but I thought a camera that is 7 years newer would perform better comparatively.

I managed to get the HDRCX405 on sale from Amazon (direct from Amazon) for about $130. That was a steal.

PROs:
------------
-Very lightweight.

-Infinitely expandable storage space with inexpensive class 10 MicroSD cards.
The 2008 model had a 40gb physical hard drive (heavy and fixed)

-Good battery life.
No moving parts except for focus zoom

-Great zoom

-Simple operation.

CONs:
------------
-Only fair video quality in good lighting.
Not as good as the 2008 model. This new model doesn't have the Carl Zeiss lens or as large/high quality CCD as I'm used to.

-Pretty poor video quality in low light.
No worse than the 2008 model, but the 2008 model also had an IR illuminator that was nice (and fun) - could video in complete darkness. That's definitely not an option on this new camera.

-JPG compression makes stills fine for casual viewing but the photos have so much edge artifacts that they just aren't of high enough quality for good printing. I'm really picky about this

-Slow still photos
Does not allow for rapid succession of still photos.

-Simple operation, while a pro for some, is also a con
It doesn't have the granular control that I was used to with my previous Handycam from 2008.

The bottom line:
I probably should have purchased the HDRCX440 instead. That appears to have a better lens, but was more than twice the price.

This is a good, but not great video camera. Its a poor replacement for a still camera - the smart phone in your pocket is a much better still, albeit without the zoom.

All that considered - this is a sub-$200 HD video camera with a great zoom. It's tiny, and it's under $200. It's comfortable to wear on your hand for hours at a time. It's video quality is only good, but it's under $200. It's still photos stink, but it's under $200. And it's under $200. Also, it's under $200.",3
16934,243,"I've been a long time user of Sony Handycams and I was excited to upgrade a new camera. Sony's video quality has always been something I'm impressed with. I've stuck with them for about 17 years now.

First off, I was surprised at how light the camcorder is. It doesn't feel heavy at all, sometimes people associate lightness with it being cheap in quality. In my opinion, it still feels pretty solid. I also like that I'm able to charge from the USB cable that's tucked away in to the strap. Nice unexpected feature!

I love that Sony has switched from proprietary memory cards to Micro SD cards. These come so cheap nowadays that you can get a 32gb micro SD card that can handle a couple of hours of HD video.

I still am rating the CX405 with 5 stars because for the price and quality that you get, it's fantastic. I wish the CX405 could have some apps like slow motion or any of the others that you can get with the Sony Nex cameras. But for simple point and record needs with solid HD video recording, this is a great little camera!

My purposes are simple, I need a camcorder that's light, takes good quality video with good sound. The CX405 does a good job at this. I won't be shooting the next big Hollywood blockbuster with the camcorder (unless it's like a sequel to The Blair Witch Project). But it will capture my travel trips and family events just fine.

I've had a number of Handycam cameras for my amateur needs. Sony has always done a great job on making tough, unassuming camcorders. I've put all of them through the wringer and with some of them being 15+ years old, they still work today! My only reasons for upgrading is that the technology continually improves. Great little camera that won't break your budget.",5
16935,244,"I clearly got not what I was buying - but it might be better deal anyway. I got CX440 model. (Not the CX405 model). It DOES have internal memory (8GB); it is probably worth $100 more than what I paid , even used. It did not come with memory card. It came with charging cable for wall plug in - which connects to the USB in the wrist-strap. And the builtin USB cable in the wrist-strap does all the data connection you need to transfer the data. I was able to process videos with my Sony Play Memories software, to make home movies, to post online. Video quality is great. Sound is great. Zoom response is great.
Seriously best deal of the year!",4
16936,245,nice camera !,5
16937,246,"I bought this camera because I, like a few hundred thousand (maybe up to million, now) people on the internet decided they wanted to vlog on youtube. There's some cons that are a little challenging, but it's really more of a learning curve than a ""con"".

The camera films in multiple formats, or rather it saves your video in two formats simultaneously. The first, traditional mp4, which is not a really high quality. The second, which can be one of two options with multiple frame rates selected, is the AVCHD or the XAVCS HD format. The latter format gives you 1080p/30fps OR 60fps.

The software that's recommended to manage, which isn't too bad, so Play Memories. You can clip videos together, but forget any additional editing. For that, use OpenShot Video Editor - it's free and can handle the super HD format that's unique to this camera & others in it's quality range. I wish someone had told me that when I was asking questions at the store and I'm glad my Google-Fu is strong. Another hit against it, which I'm not removing a star from currently, is that there's no external mic option/input. If my youtube channel takes off, I'll probably be upgrading to a camera that has the input.

The video it shoots is really great, and the depth with the XAVCS-HD is very noticeable compared to mp4!! I highly recommend this camera and will edit this as my experience with this camera increases. If you're looking for a good camera to start on YouTube or take great home videos that put you right there in the action, you got it.

PS: If you're into vlogging, get the  Sony VCTAMP1 Monopod for Action Cam (Black)  or something comparable - the angle will be wonderful!",5

16939,248,"Good picture quality/ fast shipping. Just disapointed because you need to keep programming ""delay ""picture mode after each photo and there is no continous mode ... I asked buyer forum about these features but got no reply . Had to order to find out now sending back seams too much, so i use patience/keep repeating program but remain somewath disapointed by lack of info available!!! I even downloaded manual to see about these features but menu not properly described so Sony could improve on data available to buyers....",4
16940,249,"After too many years of not using my old camcorder because I could not find video tape for it, I just used my smart phones. Problem is, when you zoom in on asmart phone, it moves the picture and is so blurry it is not even watchable. After doing some research, I found that for my wanting to document my family through the years and do a lot of zooms, camcorders are better than smart phones, and this camcorder has great picture, powerful zoom, great sound and so convenient to be on a memory card. When it's full, I simply attach to a card reader and drag it to my video library storage. This camera is small and very light too. Makes taking videos even easier than using your phone. You simply open the monitor, open the lens and you are ready.",5
16941,250,"Just received this awesome camera! I ordered it along with Cevero's LiveShell (which I am disappointed with at the moment, because the order was messed up, items were open and missing parts).
This little dude though is AMAZING... I put in the battery which immediately brought the camera to life. Everything about it is intuitive. It guided me through set up then I opened the lens and started with zooming out and in.
Image ON THE DISPLAY (in built) is Amazing, I hope I will get as good or better image on videos.
60x optical zoom.. are you kidding me? I cold read instructions on a vitamin bottle that was about 12 feet away from me!
What surprised me most was that I had my hand cupped over the lens, ""macro"" icon appeared and I could see the lines on the inside of my hand! We use our phones all the times for photos, and we can never get that close. My wedding ring was showing clear as day with just a little light sipping through my cupped hand.
The fact that it can take different type of flash cards is awesome to me. Given that it only used 5v DC and 1.5Amps, this means I can use same rescue battery I have for my phone in case I run out of power while I am out recording in a place that I may not have access to power!
I will put it to use tonight and if I have any negatives, I will share tonight or tomorrow. If you do not see any negative, you can assume that all is AWESOME!",5
16942,251,"Image quality is sub-par. You get what you pay for. An iPhone 12 on same 1080p setting, same bit rate, will look A LOT sharper, than this camera.
I got the AX43 instead and much happier with that. Image quality is compares to the iPhone 12 if not sharper and more dynamic when on the same settings (no HDR of course). Not to mention you can use an external mic with the AX43.

I got this camera to be used for soccer games and mount it 20ft up on a pole. Having the Sony USB control port is handy as I control it wireless using a DJI Ronin SC gimbal. With a step up ring of 55mm - 72mm, I attached a sun hood for glare and use a ND filter on sunny days. Used to use an iphone to record and can't do any of this with that.",3
16943,252,"The image quality is really excellent. There is little to complain about. Everything is so bright and crisp and clear, even in low light -- it's amazing! It has a wide picture as well, more than my previous camera. And you can make manual adjustments, which is nice for when the camera is acting up. So with regards to picture quality, this is a phenomenal camera, truly.

However, the reason why I'm giving it only 3 stars - and why I will probably send the camera back - is because of the sound. The clicking of the autofocus is so audible, even in loud environments, and I just can't get over it. It really bothers me how loud the autofocus is. In my previous camera, the CX120, there was also somewhat of an issue, but only in certain circumstances, whereas here, it's just overwhelming. Other than the autofocus clicking, pretty good sound. But since the autofocus is so important to me (and to anyone), I'm disappointed.

A way to stop the clicking sound is to put the camera on manual focus. So if you want to go around with manual focus, cool. The issue is that you might not know exactly how in-focus your video is, given that it will probably all look alright on the small camera screen. Once you put it on a computer though, you might find that the image was actually slightly out of focus and you didn't realize it. This is just a possibility -- if you have a good eye, maybe you can cope.

To sum up, if you just want image, and you're getting your audio from a separate microphone, then this is definitely a good deal. But if you want image and audio together in the camera, it only goes halfway.",3
16944,253,Auto focus doesn't work unless you're about 8-10 inches away from the subject. have an older Sony camcorder and it works great.,2
16945,254,"This is the one I was looking for. I wanted something that would fit in my coat pocket, small in size, with good quality optics. Those were my main criteria for ordering this one. I like the built in lens cap. I tried a cheaper ""value"" brand for about half the money. It was not such a good value. It just did not have the picture or clarity of this little honey. It was returned. This one is very simple ,with only a few buttons...I like simplicity. When I plugged it into my big screen T.V. my mouth dropped open and I was amazed at the picture quality. I also like the feature that allows you to take photos as you are filming simply and seamlessly, with no stoppage. The zoom is unbelievable. It zooms with no noticeable reduction in sharpness or clarity. I like the built in charger as well. It would really be nice if it came with a remote for playback, but oh well. I am still learning about this product as I just received it this afternoon. So far I am pleased and will be keeping this one.",4
16946,255,"Sony has always been my ""go to"" when I need reliable electronics; everything from car stereo, surround sound, and video games (emaphatically anti-xbox). This camera is great in almost every way. Great video, great still shots, great weight. The only things I wouldn't classify as great would be battery life (about a hour) and ease of moving video from the camera to your PC/Mac. Sony wants you to use some proprietary software; why can't I just plug it in then drag and drop onto my desktop? It took a little work but I was able to get it there without the Sony software; it did divide my videos up for some reason and some were even different formats (windows media vs quicktime). If you use anything other than the big two you're out of luck as well. Honestly, with all the issues involving hacking nowadays I really don't understand why anyone would still be using a winblows based system; GET LINUX. Unfortunately Megacost (microsoft) and Apple have a stranglehold on the consumer market. Ok, rant over.

Bottom line: Great camera",4
16947,256,"We love it. We got this camera for our wedding shower/wedding since we couldn‚Äôt afford a videographer and knew we wanted to start at home videos anyways. We‚Äôve since used it to record home projects, birthdays, holidays, daily life, etc. and it‚Äôs been just perfect. Recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a classic at home video cam",5
16948,257,"I read some of the other reviews and I did not experience similar
problems. The video recorded played back well and was crystal clear
with excellent audio. The only complaint I have is the videos recorded
in the low light mode were not as clear or pronounced as I had expected
them to be with the exmor chipset. I will admit a little disappointment,
but not enough to want to return. This camera is small and you would
treat it delicately and carefully because it is plastic and easily broken,
I suspect. Nice little handycam",5
16949,258,"PROS:
When I bought this camera I was surprised at how many features it had. It could zoom extremely far, it could be attached to a external display, the screen rotates, full manual control of focus, exposure, Iris, and shutter speed. It records in both XAVC and AVCHD, at 60 FPS. The battery can be removed if using a Sony power brick(comes in box) so that it can be recording for a indefinite amount of time. The camera records very well in low light because it has a back-light CMOS
CONS:
Video quality is okay, but I would expect something a little better at this price range. This camera has a very small sensor (1/5.8 inch in comparison Iphone 6 has a 1/3 inch sensor), about the size of a smartphone camera, and because of this, many videos have a little grain to them. If you are looking for a camera with less grain, for about the same price, I would go with the WX-350 it has a much bigger sensor. Also, the manual lens cover is pretty stupid.",4
16950,259,"Bought this little puppy to video tape bands..... it's a really nice camera but I wish I had splurged
for a higher model with a microphone input jack..

The video is nice.... I use it in low light conditions and it picks up the action okay, just very jerky
as people move . In sunlight it's great. It gives you a choice of recording formats AND offers dual
recording in MTS (sony proprietory) and mp4 format. Lightweight, image stabilization, great
mileage on a battery charge and the micro sd cards are swappable so you never need run out
of storage.

You need to use the joystick to move between settings. The older handicams used
a mode switch and push button so you could move between video and photo with the
push of a button. With this model, you stop filming, look down, use the joystick to
select photo mode, lift it up again, take a photo and then look down and use
joystick to put back into video mode. Definitely time consuming hassle.

This camera is good for general purpose shooting but when recording events where sound is
important i.e. weddings, receptions, lectures, concerts, bands.... this does not cut it at all....
go with a model with an external mike jack and purchase a good quality mic.

Sound is blah okay... it will pick up voices well. The problem comes in when recording bands or music
as this picks up the mid-tones and does not do bass at all. So if you are trying to record
a baritone vocalist with a guitar, the guitar comes through as tinny and the vocalist can barely be heard.

Other reviewers have commented on the poor quality sound.... that is an issue... you will not get quality
sound with this unit..",2
16951,260,"My son did not like it, he felt the quality was too grainy. He used it though for school. He and his classmates were able to pass their video class.
He left it at his friend's house. Another friend of his friend saw it and tried it out. He loved it so much that he kept it and even when asked to return it refused. Bypassing the obvious issue, at least I know it is being used more than it was at our house - unless of it has already been pawned(??).",5
16952,261,"I like this camera, but the manual, even the downloaded version, needs clarification. There are many video file types, recording modes, etc to choose from. But no where does it tell you how to get the best quality video's that can be copied to a Blue Ray. They describe file type without really defining what they mean. I had to do hours of searching on the internet to figure out which are the best for what I wanted to do. All I wanted to do was edit and copy the files onto a Blue Ray Disc. ""S"" files, ""HD"" files, ""FX"" files,.....etc...what!!!? After doing much research I was able to figure out what each file type meant, what I needed to choose from in order to get the best quality pictures. The camera is very light, easy to handle, and yes I would recommend it.",4
16953,262,I have always used Sony cameras. I see a lot of reviews good and bad about every product. I never pay any attention to review about Sony camcorder. Because I have been using them for decades and never had a single issue with the camcorders. Pictures always turn out exceptionally beautiful and the camcorder is very easy to use. I wouldn't spend so much money on a camera because this one does the job great. We have used it on our vacation to Turkey and it was easy to carry and the battery lasted so long it was unbelievable. My husband kept making remarks of how long the battery was lasting. He was so happy about it and so was I. I was looking to go into Best Buy to buy it but I saw that Amazon was selling it. How can you go wrong with Amazon? I have decided to purchase it through Amazon instead.,5
16954,263,"This Sony flag camcorder CS405, easy to use, simple operation, the manual is also easy to understand. It shots clear video, and has everything need, except WiFi, stereo sound recording. However, the camera portion is very poor, because the shot button is at such awkward location and such poor shape which makes the picture taking shaken and blur (big failure for a nice 9.2 MP feature. The handy USB cable is so poor designed and will be broken. I wish Sony could put a hole to connect this cable. The microSD is awkwardly too tiny, Previous Hard Drive Sony 40GB, 60GB, or 80BG can last more than 60 hours. How long this 32GB or 64GB memory card can last? I recommend this product, it is a good device (score 4) for our need. The price is very reasonable.",4
16955,264,"What to say about this video camera... Above and Beyond! I have never had a interest in video cameras, but we started having babies in the family. I felt it was a special time to start capturing memories because the kids grow up so fast. Who would have guessed that Sony - HDRCX405 HD is the best everyday camera for your needs. The picture, sound quality -- nothing short of amazing! Highly recommend this camera even if it is your first camera to begin with. I am so happy!",5
16956,265,"So far I have recorded two videos with this. I like the simplicity of it. I like the fact that it is not a touchscreen. It seems easier to navigate and select options with the toggle switch. This thing is super light. The default setting records in two modes. One regular and one mpeg4. You can also take pictures while filming, which is a feature I will probably never use. I was surprised I had to turn it on by opening the screen to have it register as a device on my laptop. Sony chat support is excellent as well. They helped me set it up with my laptop and patiently answered all of my questions. Even though the price of this camcorder went up $30 on the day I finally had the funds to purchase it, I still think it is worth it, and probably the best one in this price range. I checked the sony pdf manual and found the ""Sony 64GB Micro SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card (SR64UY2A/TQ)"" per sony chart on amazon.",5

The ability to take a still pic while recording is great. That button is easy to use too. The zoom function is really nice, it's a toggle switch on top. All functions of this can be used one handed so if that's important you'll be happy. I use it on a tripod so I use both hands.",4
16960,269,"This handycam is indeed handy after a long learning curve. The camcorder does not come with a memory card, so I purchased the Sony HDR-CX405 Camcorder Memory Card 32GB microSDHC Memory Card with SD Adapter separately. Setting up and operating the camcorder has been a challenge. The Instruction booklet has a lot to be desired, so I spent many hours viewing u-tubes and websites to learn how to operate it, I wish there were in depth video instructions on Sony's website. There is a very small button to select up, down, left and right on the LCD screen that is very difficult for users with normal size fingers. Using my fingernail is the only way to make the button work. Playback instructions are confusing and I have yet to tackle that.
The Free Play Memories Home app for the PC gives you the ability to delete frames, resize and crop. Initially the download did not go well and I had to restore my computer to a previous point to uninstall and reinstall the program.

It seems like the vacation slides and home videos of my generation are getting replaced with online streaming (Facebook, YouTube, etc). Most websites don't want the kind of quality videos you can get out of this camcorder because they're HUGE files and take a very long time to upload.

I initiated started archiving home videos in HD, but the files got to be too large, so I started using their ""smaller streaming files"" instead. Faster to upload online, and most people don't care whether it's HD or not when watching from mobile devices. HD (at least for now) seems reserved for TV shows and real movies; you can probably get away with ""standard definition"" quality for your typical HOME movies.",5

Of course, it is definitely not a professional camera in any other way. Extremely limited controls, there is practically nothing you can do but start and stop, no recording in 23.976 frames per second, which would have been a plus to open up its use as, for example, an unmanned b or c camera within a documentary project, allowing it to better intercut with footage from other cameras that may be in 24p.

I'm complexly happy with it. Focus camera added a ton of accessories in the bundle that you need but would spend another $50 or more with the camera bag, tripod, micro SD card, extra battery, cleaning kit, a generic Lens Pen cleaning pen, and more that makes it an even better value.

16980,289,"I bought two of these cameras as most of the reviews were good and said the picture quality was decent. My purpose for these cameras was to film my pinball playing.

My videos are all indoors, but focusing on well lit pinball machines.

As another reviewer noted, looking at the video on the small screen of the camera doesn't reveal just how bad the video is. The video on the camera looks clear and sharp. But view it on a PC, and it's extremely pixelated and of very poor quality. Search my name on YouTube and look at the Xenon or Silverball Mania videos to see the quality.

The batteries are a joke, and you can't film with the camera plugged in and on a tripod, because the charging system consists of a small plug with USB connector, and the USB connector cord supplied is extremely short. I was shooting some video today and achieved a whopping 23 minutes of use when the battery died, unaware to me, so my video was ruined. I have to fully charge the battery on both cameras before using them. One of the camera's batteries seems to hold the charge better than the other one.

I am so disgusted by these cameras, and now it's too late to return them. I thought maybe fiddling with the shutter / color setting would improve picture quality, so I shot several videos at different settings, but that didn't improve the quality.",1
16981,290,"to start with, me seller did nothing wrong. didn‚Äôt misrepresent over promise. this camcorder is just poorly made in every possible way. it‚Äôs super lightweight, and just feels cheap. with that said, i could have been fine with them at aspect of it, but my god, the picture quality was just awful. pixelated blacks, and very chalky scenes. nothing crisp to these videos at all. truth be told, your phones video camera is likely a hundred times better than this.
i even tried filming outside in the daylight hoping it would be much better but as much as i hate to say it, i‚Äôm still very disappointed in the video quality.
maybe i‚Äôm just spoiled by my canon vixia which was an amazing camcorder.",2
16982,291,"I got this specifically to record my son's high school soccer games and it works really well. I have to admit that my previous camera was not HD, so this was a big upgrade in picture quality. I like that the USB cord is built-in. It makes it really easy to transfer to my computer.",5
16983,292,"I love that it has a little USB connector attached to the camera itself, this is very handy when I need to play back on a screen or transfer files.
Very compact, sturdy, universal to my tripod, and is very simple to maneuver. Picture quality is okay when you capture an image, though we have a photography camera so by comparison it's not the best.
Video quality is great though, sound quality is great. We have been able to capture a lot of amazing moments in our lives because of this camera and how lightweight it is.",5
16984,293,"Long zoom, great stabilization, noisy quality in lower light.",4
16985,294,"I'm still working my way through using this Handicam and working with the video it produces, but so far I've been quite pleased with it. It weighs almost nothing, battery life is good (although I did get a couple of spare batteries and a charger), and the capacity of the memory card has been great. I also like being able to use it for still frames while shooting video or just using it as a camera. The reach of the zoom lens is impressive. Having to shoot with the screen pulled out is a little awkward at times, and I could be a little happier with the placement of the controls from an ergonomic standpoint.

So far, so good though.",5
16986,295,Purchased the Sony HD Video Recording HDRCX405 Camcorder to use in video taping wildlife and birds. I spend a lot of time doing wildlife photography and this added another dimension. Have been very happy with the camcorder to date. The zoom is exceptional and the picture quality excellent. Battery life is great and the camcorder is so small and lightweight you can literally stuff it in your pocket and take out when you want to use it. Have also used it to video tape school events and its been a joy to use.,4
16987,296,"Very nice, but very thin cheap plastic body. Funtionally, very good, but I'd have bought a model with an external mic input instead. Do yourself a favor and buy the extended warranty. I dropped it the first time I used it (knocked over the tripod), and the case separated, but I snapped it together again. The case is very, thin and cheap. If you're looking for something solid, you'll want to spend a bit more. But, for keeping in one place it's ok, I guess. Not something I'd travel with, though. It's too flimsy. Takes good pictures (still and HD video), but the sound quality is sub-par. In hindsight, I'd have read up a bit more before buying it. It's nice as a backup, though, and I've done some video interviews with it, and they turned out well. It's overall...meh...ok, nothing great.",3
16988,297,"I've had this camera 2 days and am very happy with it. It's very light weight, almost feels like a toy. Another reviewer said it was the size of a soda can and that's accurate. The video and sound quality on 720 is very good. It will take a 64gig micro sd card without problem. I think it does fine in somewhat low light. the zoom feature is excellent. It doesn't get grainy. The only drawback is It will record in mp4 but you have to have it in dual mode to do this. You can't just chose one file type over another. This is according to Sony help. It doesn't really bother me but might bother some.",5
16989,298,"My first use was to record my son's basketball game. I was able to record the entire game which was about 50 mins and barely used any battery life. When I got back home and watched the video on my tv the quality was fantastic. It was not grainy, and the lighting was perfect (we were in a gym), the court is so big I didn't think the built-in mic would be able to pick up good sound quality, but I was wrong. The sound quality was loud and clear on my tv. Overall we are impressed with this camera!",5
16990,299,"Well, Over all this camcorder is pretty sound for the price. While you're moving the picture is distorted a bit. But when you are sitting still it is great quality. It also does not lose quality as you zoom in which is pretty nice.
PROS:
-Does not lose quality as you zoom
-Preview screen turns 180 Degrees
-Very Light
CONS:
-Poor quality while moving
So for the money I would give this 4 stars, Not 5 for the simple fact that it is very pixelated while moving.",4
16991,300,"Everything about the camera is great. However the software that you use to import, export, and edit your videos is complete garbage. I've been trying to figure out how to download 4 clips from playmemories to my actual computer hard drive for 2 hours. Total pain in my ass",3
16992,301,"I have read many of the reviews of this camera and found A LOT of the complaints to be flat out not accurate. I have found this camera to be SUPER EASY to use with fantastic video clarity, color and focus. If you use the highest level of video option then you will get a truly HD video. I had no problem importing this directly into my iMovie on my MAC and various photo/video programs on my PC. The zooming is GREAT. The image stays in focus the whole time. I accidentally dropped this vidoe camera from about 8 ft high straight onto the cement. Although it got banged up it still works perfectly!",5
16993,302,"I have been using video cameras since the mid-80's for travel and family memories. The advances in technology have been remarkable and this camera is just amazing. Very nice pictures in a simple to use and amazingly small and light package. The bundle from Focus is a real bargain. A nice case, a memory card, and an extra battery with charger was something I wanted, anyway, and all the rest was gravy. I highly recommend this package.",5
16994,303,"For the price this seems like a good deal but chances are you'll get a refurbished one. It will come packaged well but any time I got one in a store it had stickers on the camera itself, this didn't. Even though it was sold by amazon & listed as new

It works ok..the zoom gets so blurry (even with a tripod) that it becomes almost cell phone quality at about 40 yards. Very pixelated! But this is a basic camera at a low price. You get what you pay for",3
16995,304,"I love my new camera, great at night games, indoors, lightweight, easy to use. The down fall is the battery doesn't last 3 hours so you better have an extra one on hand if your filming longer then 3 hours. Very happy with mine.",4
16996,305,"Ye gods!!!! This thing is no bigger than a soda can and weighs almost nothing. The quality of the lens is fantastic. I zoomed into my computer from about thirty feet away and was able to read a Wiki article through the camera. The menus take a little getting used to, but this thing is really pretty decent. Sound quality could be a tiny bit better, but everything you need is here. They've even got this cool setup where the USB is actually attached to the camera and tucks into the hand strap so you won't lose it. Charging wire is separated and easily connects. I wouldn't want to drop this on concrete as it doesn't look like it's built for punishment.",5
16997,306,Putchased this got my daughter. We used it at her baby shower and the sound and video was awesome. Very easy to use and so light you forget you are holding it. These things have come a long way since the 80s.,5
16998,307,I bought this to build a streaming rig for pinball. It is easy to use and produces good video quality of fast moving pinballs and strobing lights.,5
16999,308,"This is my first handycam, and I have been quite impressed with its normal functions. The documentation for this little guy is not complete, and I am not sure that I would buy it again. I have no intention of getting rid of it because it delivers such stunning image quality and it is to easy to use.

An important function to me is its ability to take such high quality stills. It is easy to carry this light-weight camera about to use for both video and still images, with superior image quality .",5
17000,309,It is handy. I would like the lens cover to open when scree is opened to shoot,4
17001,310,"The shipper/vendor was great! Got the camera on time, and with the components I expected. Of course this is an inexpensive camera, and it feels cheap. When recording the 1080p setting prevents you from taking pictures (stills), or at least at the megapixels you expect. The 1080p video is grainy, and of poorer quality. The 1080i video is also ""OK"", but nothing special. Because this is an inexpensive camera, I guess I can't complain, but if you're wanting to record family memories, or any video you want to be look back on with fond memories, or any video where a lot of things are moving, I recommend you pass on this camera. For quick/easy shooting, with lower quality video, and options, this camera is great.",3
17002,311,"A very nice little camera for us: We are beginners in filming for YouTube. And this thing handles nicely and still has not too bad sound from the inbuilt microphones (careful, no jack for externals) and we can even connect a bigger screen by (provided) HDMI cable, while we are filming. Good for studio work when filming for a long time. Less need to hunch over the tiny inbuilt screen.

I recommend getting more extra batteries. We ordered non-Sony and they worked fine, camera did not refuse or under-perform on generic batteries.",5
17003,312,"If you got an android or iphone, its probably 10 times better than this camera. Yes this was a great camera and i did give it a chance with its good reviews and the fact that it is still selling. I was shocked at the bad image quality. It can do decend videos in sunlight but even then look elsewhere.",3
17004,313,"So far, so good. I was a little disappointed this didn't come with any memory, but I knew that in advance so I purchased a memory card. This little thing is light weight, seems to be pretty solid (as in it does not seem too fragile,but I wouldn't try throwing it against the wall to test this theory). The video quality looks pretty good so far. I will update my review once we have had a chance to use it more (bought it as a late Christmas gift Jan 2017). But my initial report is that this appears to be a great product.",5
17005,314,"This camcorder is easy to use and very intuitive. I am not very tech savvy, but even I have caught on quite quickly. I hooked it up to a large screen tv and could see what I had recorded and it was almost like a Hollywood production. I am delighted with this product. I do wish it would use a larger size memory card, however.",5
17006,315,"The first time I used it and the first memory card was full, I put another in and the message on the screen said that it cannot be used since it was recorded in another format, this happened with all 7 cards I tried. This is ridiculous since my last camcorder was exactly the same as this one. The date is impossible to set up. Brand new camcorder and it's acting as if it's 10 years old.",1
17007,316,Great quality camera at the price point. Zoom feature is great. Would recommend you take a close look at this one.,5
17008,317,This little camera is awesome! I took it to the Supernatural Convention in Dallas 2019 and it did a great job recording the panels. The quality was excellent. It's very easy to use and it's small and lightweight. I forgot my tripod so I held it for over an hour recoding Jared and Jensen's panel and I didn't get tired of holding it. I highly recommend this camera.,5
17009,318,Great overall. Easy to operate.,4
17010,319,Great camera for price. Clear picture. Works great!,4
17011,320,I lost my camera but it was a very nice record. So long,5
17012,321,"The camera itself is nice. The image quality is good. I absolutely hate the way you have to charge it. Having the charger built into the camera isnt going to last very long. Then it breaks and you have no way to charge it. Also, it's made of children's toy plastic. I had an older version and it was heavy duty. This feels like it will break just by opening it. The feel of this camera, you shouldn't pay over $29.99 for it. I was pretty disappointed in the quality, but I needed a new camera fast, so I thought getting the same brand would be alright.",3
17013,322,no audio in HDMI output,3
17014,323,"Feels a little cheap, but more importantly, it's a pain to get videos off of this. It requires special software, and videos are not easily extractable from the SD card. I also wish there were better, more intuitive menus, as navigation (including looking through recordings) is slightly less than perfect. Also, the speakers are horrid and tinny (for listening to playback, though that's not a killer downside). What is kind of a pain is that sometimes noise cancellation does not work as expected (trims bits that ought not be trimmed when very quiet, or else leaves noise such as its own electronic noise). The noise cancellation bit is tweakable, however.",3
17015,324,"Camera works great, love the mini tripod also works like a selfie stick.",5
17016,325,Got this for my son for xmas and he's loving it. Easy to use and setup and the picture quality is really good.,5
17017,326,"This video camera does an ok job but I‚Äôm not in love with it. The body of the video camera feels super flimsy and cheaply made. The camera menu feels antiqued and the color and quality of the ‚ÄúHD‚Äù is not really good. I have to admit that I was expecting more from Sony. The only thing I like is that it includes the onboard usb charging cable and I wish more manufacturers would include those. Ultimately, this video camera was a disappointment and I wish I would have spent more and bought the 4K model with all of the bells and whistles.",3
17018,327,Yes it is that good! I love this Handycam. Bought it to do Youtube videos and it has fabulous quality. Unbeatable for the price. Big bonus I got all the extra goodies for the same price as just the recorder at the big box store.,5
17019,328,Great picture quality its faster then what the human eye can pick up in real time. Great zoom in capability and extremely easy to use. Best bang for your buck compared to all other models in close price range.,5
17020,329,"This camera is everything I expected and a little more. Sound is not the greatest and I wish it had an option for an external mic but it doesn‚Äôt.

The only flaw I can talk about is that the plastic around the tripod screw has broken in several places while mounted to the tripod.",4
17021,330,I use this for YouTube uploads. It's got the best microphone and my viewrs appreciate good sound. Only trouble was finding the best settings because my first Sony Camera was already set perfectly out the box. This one wasn't.,5
17022,331,"Estoy satisfecho con el producto; tiene excelente calidad normal y con el zoom.
Tiene una muy buena calidad",5
17023,332,"This is a great little camera, really good zoom!",5
17024,333,"I have gotten Sony vid cams for years, so I have interchangeable parts. I do need to upgrade, but this camera is sufficient",5
17025,334,"I got this camera as a gift for my wife and we love it. It is small and lightweight. We use it all the time, both for family adventures and for sports. It is easy to get video off of it, the zoom works well, the controls are easy to use, and video quality is good. The directions for the camera could be better, but it wasn't hard to figure out how to use.",5
17026,335,"Overall, better technolgy should be more affordable. I bought this video camera for presentations so I can promote my product. All video cameras need to operate with a remote so that a camera man is not needed while another is presenting.",5
17027,336,"Other than the deliver issues, this is a great little camera for streaming and other easy DIY video",5
17028,337,I love this little camera. I use it for hunting and adventure videos for my podcast show Outdoor Savages NW and this little camera is amazing. Great quality video and easy to use. Only con is there is no audio attachment for a shotgun mic for higher quality audio. Has amazing zoom though.,4
17029,338,"I bought this after being disappointed with a GoPro camera. I wanted to have a screen to look at so that I knew exactly what I was filming, which you can't really do with a GoPro. The video quality is good. I use it to document travel experiences, nothing fancy. It feels a little cheap because of the plastic housing, but this is inconsequential.",4
17030,339,"The camera itself is fine for the money, but I have a few gripes with it. There's no on/off switch, it just turns on and off when you open the screen. There's also a faint rolling sound from inside the camera whenever it's recording, which gets into the audio recording, which is also annoying. Otherwise it's great for what you're paying for.",4
17031,340,"I bought this for Christmas 2018 and we've had no issues with it!! We use it to record family times and sporting events and it's very lightweight, compact and easy to use!! The bundle came with everything we needed!!",5
17032,341,This camcorder gives great video at the 1080P level. Use it for son's football games and it is quick to focus during zoom and adapts quickly to changing lighting conditions. I don't use the audio but it seems to be of good quality. Easy to set and use even for novices.,5
17033,342,"It records in AVI which I didn't know and don't like. The zoom is jerky, not smooth. Picture quality only OK.",3
17034,343,I couldn't charge it and stream at the same time,5
17035,344,"Fast delivery, great items with fantastic warranty. Will definitely be purchasing more for the household I bought this product a couple of days ago and is being doing a wonderful job keeping cockroaches out of my house Great product at an affordable price! My brother need so cool product . It serves it purpose, heavy duty, nice grip Love it and really fast shipping!",5
17036,345,"Wrong product description!
Attached photo shows the delivered.
It‚Äôs missing a card reader.
It‚Äôs missing a cleaning brush.
And, instead of a DSLR camera holster case, it was a point/shoot camera case!
No choice but return.:(",1
17037,346,"I was very happy with the product, the service and their timing! Super trustful",5
17038,347,"I am very pleased with this cam. It is light weight with an ease of use second to none. The thing i am most impressed with is picture quality. For the price i wasnt expecting much more then it to work. It is far better then i could have ever expected. You can take still pics as you record without interuption and has great sound as well. Editing is simply done on device. I did not receive anything for my review. If this helps, please let us know.",5
17039,348,"Fantastic buy. Using this model for 8 years now, just got a new one.",5
17040,349,Nice camera that I'm using to film basketball gsmes. A slightly wider angle lens would be helpful but the camera works great and is simple to use. At full HD I get about an hour of recording time. I bought a 64gb class 5 memory card that has enough storage to hold 5 or 6( or probably more) full games.,4
17041,350,Fantastic camera! The camera bag that came with the package doesn‚Äôt get used often so I was disappointed that the supper is already separating. However the camera was a wonderful purchase.,5
17042,351,My daughter loves it. She records everything.,5
17043,352,"product arrived on time and in great condition, as a bonus surprise instead of the 32gb micro sd card a 64gb micro sd card was included at no additional cost. The Image and video quality is great though a bit grainy in low light,",4
17044,353,"I ordered used item but condition is good.
I‚Äôm very satisfied zoom function and image quality. Love it.",5
17045,354,"I was expecting to be able to record in XAVC because I got a class 10 SDHC card (32GB) as it said to. Upon first use the camcorder would not let me use the XAVC option, because the memory card wasn't compatible... I now know that it is supposed to be a SDXC memory card, even though if you search the questions for this product, we have a verified MANUFACTURER telling us that, and I quote - ""Hi Jose, no, there's no need to use the SDXC card to shoot in the highest quality video format for this unit. Thanks_Mitch"". If I'd have known that this was a lie, then I would have purchased an SDXC card and not an SDHC. Aside from this, the pictures are very grainy and require a light source in the area to be atleast the intensity of a noon day sun - Not very useful when the primary purpose was for birthday parties and indoor events.",2
17046,355,"Camera is great, light weight, took it to New Mexico captured, Saw Roswell Museum, White Sand National, and Carlsbad Caverns! The battery could use some improvement, compared to other electronics it needs a charge after a day. But picture quality is great, zoom and focus are fast and easy. Would recommend!",4
17047,356,This camera was probably the cheapest piece of plastic I have ever bought. For 228$ you would think that you would have a decent camera... WRONG. I am floored at how low quality plastic crap this camera was. The camera didn't even have buttons on it. It had one little flat knob that your push in the direction you want select. I promise you could buy at 50$ kids camera and it be better quality then this junk. I really hope that some how I received a fake Sony knockoff .. if not I am done with Sony. This was a Christmas present and I am so glad I opened it early to charge the battery. I would have been so embarrassed for my family member to have gotten this. I did send it back for a refund and Amazon was awesome and took care of it.,1
17048,357,"The price was great, the product is amazing and I love it!",5
17049,358,"I love it! First, the delivery was just as described. Secondly, the camera is soooo light you hardly know you are holding it. The clarity is fantastic! The zoom is unreal! Now, you have to know I am a 68 yr. old person that is up to date with this type of product and I love this camcorder. I take photo's to sell. I am taking it to Maui next month and catch some good video and it also takes still photos. Look for my photos online and in your nearest stationary store.",5
17050,359,Very disappointed the time-date stamp isn't permanent on the video. I need for investigation.,3
17051,360,Bought this when I had my first child. Don‚Äôt regret it one bit. Great quality (as long as you have the settings set accordingly (see picture in which I screenshot somebody‚Äôs comment from youtube on how to get 1080p quality). Pictures are great but watching videos from years ago Is so much better. If you want to cherish memories with a reasonable priced video camera this one is a great choice!,5
17052,361,"better then all the unbranded ""8k"" camcorders",5
17053,362,"It works well enough. The picture is not as sharp as I would like and in under-lit locations, it is horrible. I was hoping this would take better video than my iphone 6s plus. It doesn't. One exception, the optical stabilization is excellent. That alone is the reason I kept it.",4
17054,363,Needed a new one,4
17055,364,"Worked great for 3 or 4 months then developed a screen display problem so is back at Sony getting evaluated and hopefully repaired. Great super optical zoom with additional digital (loss of resolution) zoom. Simplistic design, not quite so simple navigating the menus.",4
17056,365,"I bought this for my daughter who is young. The plastic seems cheap but the video quality is good. I shopped reviews and didn't price in stores so I'm not sure I received the best deal, but I am happy.",4
17057,366,"Sony is a great brand name. I had a sony camcorder which lasted me about 13 years, so I stayed with this brand. This camera is inexpensive but only 1 word to describe it(Great value, Great product). My only sad face, was that no instruction manual came with this camera. And the battery seems to die quick.",5
17058,367,"Terrible low light quality. Shooting video in anything other than broad daylight results in incredibly grainy video that looks like an oil painting when you pause it. Daylight video looks great but no different than a flagship smartphone could do. If everyone would stop focusing on this stupid lighter and smaller is better kick, they could've put some decent optics in this thing. It's so light it feels like a toy. I don't need my smartphone any smaller and I haven't complained about the size of my video camera since they stopped using vhs tapes. Btw it doesn't say it in the description but you need a certain size/type of memory card in order to use the new HD mode. I believe it's 64gb or higher, a quick Google search will tell you. So if you don't already own one, factor that sd card cost into the overall price if you want to utilize that mode.",2
17059,368,Purchased this to record my girls cheerleading competitions and softball games and absolutely love it! I plug it into my 55 inch TV to watch and the picture is far better than expected. It is such a small camera I can carry it with me everywhere by placing it in the small pocket of the girls bags. The only complaint I have is the lens cover is very flimsy but it is not enough to make me like the camera any less.,5
17060,369,I received this as a gift for my birthday - and wow what a difference it has made. Now videos I take can be uploaded to YouTube with minimal editing and significantly less time. The menus are a little different from the previous model I had (the HDR-CX190). The only thing I miss is the (usually accurate) estimate of remaining battery life,5
17061,370,Man how I love this camera. I use it for production on my youtube channel along with my gopro hero 4 session. The quality is unbeatable and I usually always have the fan on in the shop aiming right at me or the camera and the mic gives absolutely no wind noise. And yea I have dropped it off the side of the truck and it still works perfect.,5
17062,371,"This is a replacement for the same model that my OCD disabled son who takes pictures of nature constantly.....it‚Äôs easy to use, download and go again! Would like to know more about longer lasting batteries and memory cards. The PlayMemories program is great!",5
17063,372,"Excellent video recording- not pro level but we got it for my daughter to start a video blog/Youtube channel. There are a lot of similar models from different companies, this one I chose because it is optimized for recording a human face well. Most of the Sony units are like this, this one was the best bang for the buck- the fancier features other had in addition to what this provides were nice, but we had to keep things within a budget.",5
17064,373,"The video quality on this camcorder is not good. My 5 year old cell phone takes better video. New cell phones are MUCH better video quality. It is difficult to delete files off of it. After 2 months, I still have no figured out the best way of doing so. The battery life is awful. I have to leave it plugged in if I use it for longer than 10 minutes. The audio pickup is so-so. Honestly, I feel like returning it. If you own a smart phone that has been produced within the last 5 years, don't waste your money on this.",2
17065,374,"I love it so far and I'm super impressed with how lightweight and tiny it is, as well as the picture/audio quality from what I can tell so far. I bought this to take family videos and for an upcoming vacation so I will update my review if I experience any issues taking/finishing a video but I'm impressed so far!",5
17066,375,i gave it 2 stars for the video quality. it looks pretty good for the price. but man trying to get the video from the camera to laptop is ridiculous! why can't i just upload my video via my laptop mediaplayer like i used to? when i use the media cable provided nothing happens! i don't think my windows 10 recognizes it. now i've got to get a micro sd card adapter so i can put the card directly into the laptop. tried to play my videos online with the idiotic playmemories online and still nothing! what a pain!,2
17067,376,Bought this to record sporting events. Maybe we got a defective camera but I sure was disappointed when I went to watch replays from a soccer tournament. The picture quality was nowhere near HD. My wife has better videos that she took with her cellphone. Don't waste your time or money with this camera.,1
17068,377,"It shoots OK video, but only at 60 frames, and even then, it's doesn't always shoot clear video, especially indoors. As others have stated, it is very toy-like in construction, and just a few weeks into owning it, the camera would not acknowledge whether the lens cover was open or shut. Also, the auto-focus began to slow down or not work at all which was frustrating when there is no manual-focus on this camcorder. It worked best with outdoor landscape scenes in bright sunlight. Overall, I was very disappointed with this camcorder. The Canon VIXIA HF R600 (now discontinued) is much better made, and I would assume that the latest R700 model is as well. If you must stick with Sony, I would recommended passing this one by and looking at the higher-end Sony camcorders.",2
17069,378,"exceeded all my expectations. Very compact with decent sound and very good picture. I did one shoot with it and a very expensive three-year-old Sony pro-sumer HD camera and you could not tell the difference. Controls work well and are very compact-intuitive. One thing, if you order any wires or other hardware including backup storage card, battery and charger and ancillary items. It is wise to order a larger camera bag",5
17070,379,It‚Äôs a great camera for basic video capture with a long zoom and at least a little bit of stabilization. I gave it 5 stars because I‚Äôm not using it for professional caliber stuff and I like it.,5
17071,380,Arriv√© en 2 jours livraison tr√®s rapide et pour l'instant je suis totalement satisfaite . En plus j'ai re√ßu l'√©tui pour transport que je m'attendais pas √† avoir avec cette achat . Je recommande √† 100%,4
17072,381,"Absolutely wonderfull, very easy to use, compact, it is our first camcorder and we where very nervous about using it, but our fears where unfounded, and a plus is we can take photos with it too, so 2 in 1 cannot be bad.",5
17073,382,Got for personal use. Controls aren't as great as they could be. Had to hit buttons numerous times to get what I wanted done.,4
17074,383,This camera is a great value. It is not a high end camera with a lot of bells and whistles. But it is not completely a bottom lister either. With a properly lit subject this camera does well.,5
17075,384,Great,5
17076,385,Too small compared to the picture,3
17077,386,"I love this camcorder! I use it for filmmaking. I love the ability to zoom in from so far away and get a very clear picture. The sound quality is amazing!! Super clear. Great product, would definitely recommend!!",5
17078,387,"I was pleasantly impressed with the size of the camera. However, after reviewing the first set of videos I shot, my initial excitement was greatly diluted - no shattered!!! The quality of the videos was downright disappointing - hazy and amateurish. My disgust was made more poignant because this is a Sony product. Unfortunately, my sad discovery happened overseas during my first few days there. Since there was no convenient way for me to return the product from there, and by the time I came back to the U.S., my 30-day return widow had closed, I'm now stuck with a device that does not meet my need at all. I really wish I could still exchange it for something better. Hello Amazon?",2
17079,388,"Its a good little camcorder, just remember the screen is small which is hard for me to see. But it takes good video. Use it for coaching",4
17080,389,"Yes, it works great, the zoom is great, I had to put it on a tripod stick to keep the target centered, the zoom is so good.I wear it around my neck and tuck it in my shirt pocket, so I always have it ready while at the races. Good sound quality, great picture,and I can take pictures (stills) in the middle of videoing, makes for nice videos.",5
17081,390,"Very nice, small camera. Did not come with a memory card and no internal memory. Have it all set up and waiting for the memory card to actually record anything. This is great for our needs. Hoping to hiking and will make videos this weekend for YouTube.",4
17082,391,"Manque quelques options comme le remote mais pas compliqu√©. La carte m√©moire 8Go en qualit√© sup√©rieure ne fait que 6 minutes. Donc, on doit acheter une autre carte pas moins de 32 Go. Apr√®s essai tout va bien.",5
17083,392,Very happy with purchase!,4
17084,393,The item arrived just three days after the order was placed . The camera performs perfectly and the video is excellent . I'm still learning things about the handycam but so far I love it .,5
17085,394,"I liked that it can be hand-held and all the important buttons (on/off, aperture open/close, focus) can be moved w/ just one finger.",5
17086,395,"We wanted something to capture family memories. This camera was very easy to use, small and portable, and came with everything you need! Great picture quality for what we used it for.",5
17087,396,"Takes great quality movies and still shots. Great quality playing from the camera on HD TV. Seems to work pretty well in low light, contrast to some of the other reviews I've read. Still haven't used all of the features, but so far so good.",4
17088,397,Does what I want it to do. No issues. Glad I bought it!,4
17089,398,"Works great. Battery lasts about an hour and a half recording. Great picture quality. I wish it didn't record two files for everything, so I recommend getting a big memory card. 64gb works good for me. Easy to use and lightweight.",5
17090,399,"Nice light little camcorder, nice upgrade to my older but similar Sony camcorder. Like the builtin usb cord. Wish I could get extended run batteries for it like I could for the older one. More than 113 minutes run time would be a blessing.",5
17091,400,"We are really enjoying the ease of use, as well as the excellent quality of the videos. This is an excellent camcorder for simple home use. I had the older model before this, but this newer model is even easier to use, and the image stabilization is fantastic.",5
17092,401,"When this DVR works, it does a great job with quality, ease of use, and transportability. However, on multiple occasions now, including today during a key youth athletic event, it explicably stopped recording while seated on a stable tripod. When attempting to troubleshoot, the screen is solid black with only a flashing disk icon. I remove the SD card, and reseat it, but nothing changes. I ultimately end up removing the battery and reinserting it. Also, the SD card never seats exactly right, which is likely causing the issues, yet despite very carefully inserting it, it is always seated a little crooked. Not sure why as there is nothing in the slot to have caused this weird seating of the disk. I've now experienced this same string of events for the last 5 or 6 times in a row that I have used it and I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product. I will not buy this item again.",1
17093,402,It is easy to use and gives great pictures and movies,4
17094,403,"My father asked me to order him some cheap Chinese camcorder and I said no and started my research. After looking I found this one and he loves it! Typical Sony quality, the picture is fantastic and he says it's easy to use. I won't tell his age, but let's just say he's definitely an AARP member. Not that into Florida though.",5
17095,404,This was a Christmas present for my mom. When she opened it she cried of joy because she did not expect this to be her gift. So far it looks nice and the screen looks beautiful when recording. He haven't done much with it yet so ill keep updated but its surprisingly tiny. One review was not lying about it being the size of a can of soda.,5
17096,405,it is really good the zooming and the picture quality is great! it was cheap but really good i think u should buy it,5
17097,406,"Easy to hold but menu toggle was so small, I missed it and had to discover it with no help from the guide. Low light filming is marginal. Probably will get better with more use",4
17098,407,Perfect... great seller.. responsive and reliable.. was bought for my 7 year old son and he loves it,5
17099,408,Great camera for the price. I only had it for a day and used it once to check out the features and video quality. Should suit my needs perfectly.,5
17100,409,"We tried two other ""off brand"" camcorders, and none of them were compatible with the Sling Studio. This camcorder works perfectly, the key being it records in .mp4 format. Wonderful camcorder, high quality recordings and lets up live stream for hours. Highly recommend.",5
17101,410,"Good product, no issues.",5
17102,411,instant recording MP4 file for smart phones without any additional software purchase.,4
17103,412,Love this product easy to use right the box,5
17104,413,"Very light weight with good features for the cost. Video is good quality for family, sports and school functions. Battery life is nice for 90+ minute recordings.",4
17105,414,"Great little camera for the price. The mic is ok, but isn't great! Tried using it in a meeting and the mic didn't do very well at all. All the other functions seem to be working fine. Using the cam to supplement my smartphone videos.",5
17106,415,"The Sony HD Handycam is quite nice. In fact, this is my second purchase. I wanted my grandson to have the best camcorder to capture the landscape and sights while in Africa this summer. The clear still photos are excellent and are easily transferred to prints. I really like the small size with big results. It's a great buy!!
Maxine",5
17107,416,Pleasantly surprised at the picture. Very small and easy to use.,4
17108,417,This was a gift for my husband for Christmas. He really enjoys using it,5
17109,418,Good camera for the price.,5
17110,419,"for the price it is a good quality camera. nice zoom, really clear film. i wish it came with some kind of protective case because the only thing protecting it is the lens that you have to manually close.",5
17111,420,Great video camera. Was surprised at how light it is. Does the trick for me. Just amateur video with professional results when combined with the right software (Cyberlink). Save your memories bring enjoyment to the whole family. Capture those precious moments on a modestly priced Handycam. I have had several Handycam models and have enjoyed them all.,5
17112,421,This is a very good camera for recording any great occasion but I have seen older models that are kind of better this camera kind of fuels cheap in your hand it has very cheap plastic and it feels very Hollow and you have to open the recording lens and set of it automatically opening,3
17113,422,"Bought this to replace a handycam which I lost (CX 210). Good features. Very small in the hand. Seems to capture well. Need to get used to the focus on photo mode. But overall, am very satisfied.",5
17114,423,"What a perfect little camcorder. Exactly what I was looking for.
I wanted something that I literally just had to open and start shooting. No extra buttons/settings to deal with. That's exactly what I got.

Zooms amazingly far.
The picture isn't fuzzy.
Sound is great.
I'm happy.",5
17115,424,the camera felt like a toy.,3
17116,425,This is our second camera we purchased. The first one was left on the trunk hood and fell off when we darted off to chase a train. My son and I go rail fanning. The pictures are great quality and the sound is good too.,5
17117,426,Its great for my 9 year old daughter. The zoom quality is 5 star. Its takes good pictures and the video quality is good as well. It is super lightweight and user friendly.,4
17118,427,Basic but decent camcorder for the price.,4
17119,428,very nice camera. I use it for make small edits of motorcycles and auto racing. Zoom is amazing. Picture is super clear for what I need. Im almost mad that I did purchase this one sooner.,5
17120,429,"I really dislike this camera. I am so surprised with it being a Sony. the playback operation is ridiculous. Look at a photo, then start back from the beginning to see the next one. The worst part is that I took half a dozen photos of this incredibly beautiful sunset. Only one picture was there when I went to review them later. I tested this afterwards. It did NOT record on every shot. I bought this camera specifically for videos. For that, I will give it two stars. I'll use my Panasonic HD camera for the pictures. It has never failed me.",2
17121,430,"I'm underwhelmed by the video quality so far. Perhaps I need to try better lighting. But I have the camera set up for ""highest quality"", and ""60P"", and the resultant video is still not very crisp. I expected better for the money.",3
17122,431,Good,5
17123,432,Love this! It was more than what I expected. Bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! Great quality and easy to use.,5
17124,433,Nice camera for the money,4
17125,434,"This is my first video camera, so I have nothing to compare it to apart from my phone, but so far, so good.",4
17126,435,Excellent camcorder,5
17127,436,Horrible equipment does not pick up sounds but static,1
17128,437,Light weight and easy to use,5
17129,438,I love it. Just wish I didn't need a memory card for it to work.,4
17130,439,"After 10 days of trial use, I have decided to return the product for the following reasons:

1. When I use XAVCS function with Micro SDXC Class 10 Ultra Memory Card to shoot videos, picture quality is very grainy. The resolution is definitely not Full HD 1080 as advertised. On the monitor, the resolution shows HD 720.
2. The battery only lasts about 30 minutes on full charge.
3. Sometimes, the lens cover cannot close completely.",2
17131,440,love this camera and the size! its easy to carry around! my in laws use it all the time. the photos are amazing quality and videos in HD! can't beat the price when compared to other camera!! if you want a simple camera that is not to big buy it you will love it!,5
17132,441,"You have to go through the software menu system to switch between video and camera mode. Every cumbersome.
Some camcorder has a button on the camera body let switch between video and camera mode.",3
17133,442,"The play back button is not easy to use. I want the one button to do the job, not to have to move back and forth and mess up every time. The picture quality is great snd connection to TV is easy. Need to change the play back function to one single mode.",3
17134,443,Good camera for the price. Not a whole lot of extra bells and whistles but at the price point it works well and quality is very good. Very lightweight and comfortable to use.,4
17135,444,Plastic body is a minus. The fact that you have to manually open the shutter is also not great. Finding where to buy the tiny memory card is challenging. My advice is spend more to get a better model.,3
17136,445,"Works great, only liability with these cameras is the lack of a viewfinder which makes the cameras difficult to use in bright light.",4
17137,446,The camera has met my expectations. The accompanying software should have offered more editing and file conversion options.,4
17138,447,Like a kids toy. Cheap China junk you can find at Walmart. It is how we roll...,1
17139,448,Liked that it was light why. And does the job,4
17140,449,Love this camera. Only negative is there isn't any internal memory but that's easily resolved by buying a micro sd card from amazon for a fraction of the cost or using one you have already. Great quality and awesome price point.,5
17141,450,"Not really HD quality ....but not to bad
.....its a nice cool little camera .....
Thanks",4
17142,451,I‚Äôm using the camera to film wild game at the family ranch.,5
17143,452,3 months and has quit working.,1
17144,453,I ordered this for my son as a Christmas gift. He absolutely loves it!,5
17145,454,No last long battery,4
17146,455,"Great cameras! I ended up not needing the ones I ordered, but I have used this model for many video shoots as crash/2nd cameras when a producer needed to be on the run and get shots no matter what.",5
17147,456,"Worth the buy, great quality camera for this price range. Been using it for over 6 months. 0 problems with it. just make sure to get a 64gig micro SD or higher because filming at 1080P takes up a lot of space very fast.",5
17148,457,I didn't expect that it requires a mini SD card which is not very common to me.,4
17149,458,"Good: it's really small, amazingly light, turns on quickly, one button to start recording.

Bad: records to a proprietary format that isn't well supported. Can't just navigate to a directory with your files in it. Compared to my old Flip where you just plugged it in and there were your videos, this was too much hassle. The 60i, recording-two-videos-at-once feature was just weird and silly. For being twice as much as the competition I expected a really good experience. They just wanted me to download their software to import the videos. No thanks.",2
17150,459,Performed very well and delivered decent quality images for such small size + lightweight material. Survived a drop from a lounge table onto a pool patio. video image files were compatible with pinnacle studio pro.,5
17151,460,"Cheap, compact, takes decent video. Not giving 5 stars, because the battery capacity is terrible, and the battery fits entirely inside the cam, meaning larger aftermarket batteries are not possible.",4
17152,461,"Arrived quickly. Nice, easy to use camera. Simple to use. Holds easily in hand. Clear picture.",5
17153,462,"Light weight, decent picture. Bought for school but found out didn't need it. Keeping it anyway since it is a decent recorder",4
17154,463,"Although very lightweight and easy to use as are most Sony products, this camcorder had issues with the micro-SD card reader and started corrupting files. This was very frustrating (occurred after buying the highest rated micro SD card) and the camera was returned to the seller. Not a big fan of micro SD card cameras and prefer the USB cable transfer types (internal hard drive) for ease and simplicity.",2
17155,464,Takes great video. It's so light weight that I am afraid that it will break. I still can't get over that.,4
17156,465," A c√¢mera chegou em perfeito estado e a embalagem ok, excelente produto, muito f√°cil de usar, manual bem explicativo,

Gostei!",5
17157,466,"Fairly easy to setup and use. It is VERY lightweight, and the rotating screen for ""selfie"" style recording is also super handy with the little one around wanting to ""see"" herself in order to be recorded. :-)",5
17158,467,My only video recorder so I have nothing to compare it to. But I use it all the time. Very easy to get from recorder to computer and it looks good too. Easy to handle. In short I am impressed.,5
17159,468,Great product!!,5
17160,469,"Good but doesn't last. We had it just over 30 days when the shutter window quit working. Another week or so the screen quit turning on the camera when you opened it. That is intermittent and still isn't working, but not much worse. Then a week or two later it just started freeIng up and choosing not to focus sometimes. This is still happening and seems to be getting worse. Through all this it seems the video quality is getting less. It was so crisp at first. Loves quality at first, now would say don't buy for the long term issues.",2
17161,470,"Hi. I have owned many Sony products and usually love them. However, this Sony camcorder was purchased in May, 2019, and I have been having charging and recording problems. I have already had a Sony authorized dealer repair it and guess what, I am having the same problems again! Sony please help!",2
17162,471,good,4
17163,472,"Need to figure out the right settings to get the best quality video, once you do the videos are very good.",5
17164,473,"This works great. I have been using this to record events, seminars, and parties. It is very light. Even lighter the my mobile phone. I wish the charging cable was longer, but that's not a big issue. I purchased a usb cable extender.",5
17165,474,"PROS:
-very steady video shots, even while walking it looks like you are floating in the video
-small
-Super light weight (almost feels like you are holding air)
-great zoom

CONS:
-Super light weight (almost feels like you are holding air)",5
17166,475,Good Camera,4
17167,476,"great little camera, great sound and video",4
17168,477,"Very light weight, easy to use & takes very good video.",4
17169,478,"no audio over hdmi while streaming, be aware before buying. Otherwise a solid product.",4
17170,479,Very nice recorder. Zoom would be better if it was more clear,5
17171,480,"Atende perfeitamente minhas necessidades, que √© filmes educativos e pedag√≥gicos.",5
17172,481,Light weight. Videology isn't amazing. Average. About what you would expect. Nothing more,4
17173,482,"Great video's, bought it for my daughter, to take video's of my first grandbabyüòä",5
17174,483,"Camera works fine, but there is no microphone input for external audio devices, which really sucks if you film outdoors and need a directional mic or a wind-resistant mic.",3
17175,484,Great little hany cam. It weights almost nothing and even has a low light setting or those inclined to use it in those types of light. Out side it takes beautiful video and pictures and they play back well too.,5
17176,485,My 9yr old son has been using this for about three months and really likes it. It seems to take good quality video and has lasted this long in his hands so I will say it is pretty durable too.,5
17177,486,"This is a great camera, light weight, and real HD! My wife adores it!",5
17178,487,"Decent video camera. It works without the battery and can run off the wall adapter. It could do live view through HDMI however it will either show REC or standby, it basically shows what you see in the view finder.",5
17179,488,"I love this camcorder! It has excellent video quality and the zoom on the camcorder is also amazing. And the best part it that when you zoom in on something, the camera will still focus clearly!",5
17180,489,"Well built,easy to use",4
17181,490,had a problem getting to see the video it took a year for me to open package and just started filming a week ago. tried to see the work and nothing but I go the singles,5

17185,494,Not the best in the market! But good.,4
17186,495,The camera and accessories have done exactly what I purchased them for,5
17187,496,"Great picture quality, reasonable price. If you are looking for a camera to save memories, this is the camera you need and want.",5
17188,497,I used this video cam to transfer old 8 mm film from the 1950's to digital recordings making memories come alive again.,5
17189,498,My son asked me to order this video recorder for him. He is very happy with how much detail he can captor from a very long distance away.,5
17190,499,"Only good working feature was the zoom. The menu interface was glitch, it could not read any memory cards, tried standard, ensures formatted, tried micro-SD card, formated. No internal memory so couldn't even take pictures let alone video. No wifi, no external audio connections, no aux for light, or microphone. Just... I was sad.",1
17191,500,"I make all my videos with this handy little camera. I love it. Without this camera, I would have to go out and get a real job. Thanks Sony.",5
17192,501,"not ready to tell much about the recorder as I have not used enough, but I think I will like it so far.",4
17193,502,Just used to record my kids sky diving. It worked great,5
17194,503,Would give it no stars if I could. I received this today 7/13/2017. I unboxed the camera and was completely shocked. This camera is TINY!!!!! also very very light It feels like it would break at the slightest hit. My one would not hold a charge. I could turn it on when plugged directly into the wall but after a 2 hour charge it would not charge. This camera is something for a child. The battery is about the size of a book of matches. Believe me when I say it is the most basic of basic cameras. Spend about 50 bucks more and you will get a much better camera. Stay clear of this one.,1
17195,504,"This is a wonderful camera for taking pictures and videos. It is so small, compact and super lightweight! Great price and great product :)",5
17196,505,Excellent zoom and definition. Not to easy to navigate in the menu without touchscreen and a small boton at the corner of the screen,4
17197,506,Lightweight and easily portable. Sets up on tripod well. Video is great!! I use a Zoom Recorder for my audio at the same time so I didn't really care of the audio quality. I would buy this camera again!,5
17198,507,"Easy to use and convenient, takes good videos. Nice to have charging cable built right into hand strap

Just seems a little cheap. Does not feel solid. I do not believe it would survive any drops.",3
17199,508,"It works well for taking amateur videos, fits snugly in your hand. EXTREMELY easy to use.",4
17200,509,"great recorder. if it had a pause feature, I would give it a 5",4
17201,510,Love how lightweight it is. Great zoom and steady technology. Took me a while to find the usb cord hidden in the hand strap.,5
17202,511,Amazing quality for a low price. Camera itself is very lightweight and battery lasts a long time. Would highly recommend.,5
17203,512,work perfect,5
17204,513,Just received this camera and I am so surprised at the size and weight. This camera is smaller than my Samsung smartphone. Great camera. The zoom is fabulous. Light weight and fits great in the palm of your hand,5
17205,514,A very good product for it's price. Works just fine and easy to use.,4
17206,515,Good value,5
17207,516,good,4
17208,517,"Disappointed with Sony, I thought Sony was a good brand but I guess now they're in the business of manufacturing toys, this thing feels like a very cheap toy, I'm sure even some toys feel better than this junk. Horrible low light recording, no 24p recording, no remote, no mic jack, I mean whats with manufacturers leaving out a measly little mic jack all the time, that is such a small feature that it should come standard on all cameras. It has pretty good daytime recording, but still not great after looking at it closely. I say if you can't make a good camera for a particular price don't make one at all, why do it and ruin your reputation. I returned mine right away. Bottom line don't get this, its cheap junk!",1
17209,518,"The video is very clear but the buttons are a little confusing, The video format is not compatible with some editing software and can not be moved into the computer. If you want, you have to use a third party converting tool which wastes a lot of time. I am not satisfied with this camera.",2
17210,519,User friendly and small size,4
17211,520,We use it for our kids games from indoor volleyball to outdoor football games. Great camera and everything we expected and more.,5
17212,521,"My son loves his new camera, now he can film more garbage trucks. Loves the quality.",5
17213,522,Should come with a card,4
17214,523,Super Light Weight. Low light and high speed video not that good.,4
17215,524,Loved this camcorder. It recorded high quality video. Would recommend.,5
17216,525,Happy with it but disappointed that it didn't come with a memory card.,4
17217,526,For video it works perfect. Good quality for the price.,5
17218,527,"Bought only for the HDMI streaming output. I was surprised how well the lens works and how clear close up shots are (2-3""). No bells and whistles, just cheap, perfect for what I wanted with web streaming.",5
17219,528,"No Mic input. No Light. No Night Vision. very small and light for big hands.
Update 8-13-18. Pictures are Horrible on best setting! Video is Horrible on best settings. Low light recording is a complete joke and horrible picture quality! Shame on Sony to sell us this garbage quality and CLAIM its HD 45-50kbps blah blah blah chip. The only thing that works well is the zoom with stabilization. Stay away from this camera. just see pictures for yourself.",2
17220,529,Esperaba un articulo con un poco mas de mantenimiento ya que era usado.,3

17226,535,"This camcorder did not take any usable videos and now it is 2 days past the return date. I wasted time thinking I was doing somethin wrong, only to find out the quality of the camcorder was mis-represented in the description. I had an expert look at it and it was wasted money and time. There were no clear or usable videos. Amazon should send me a refund or at least allow me to upgrade and pay the difference. All I wanted was a video camcorder. My smart phone takes better videos. I would give this no stars if possible.",1

17253,562,I rated everything 1 because I couldn't rate it zero. Everything about the camera is pitiful. And it costs way too much to be pitiful. I returned one because it stopped powering up. The second one made me realize I should have just gotten my money back. No more Sony for me.,1

17259,568,Nice for the price and simple to set up.,4
17260,569,My first camcorder. Works for my needs. Audio seems to have limited range.,5
17261,570,Not wide angle. Manual is unintelligible. Very small recording time. Look elsewhere. Any Zoom brand camera would be well worth looking at. This thing is a ‚Äúdo not buy‚Äù.,1

Maybe if you have fingers the size of a pencil point - it might be easier. I would NOT BUY THIS AGAIN. I would return it - but as I gave it as a Christmas present, the return window closed in November. So much for buying stuff early. I would avoid this camera at all costs.",1

17271,580,Great item,5
17272,581,Terrible quality. Basically it does not work. It gets stuck in the Language Setting screen and would not respond to touch of language or the Next menu item. Dead on arrival so to speak. Item itself is very light and PLASTIC. So different from the old HDR-CX110 that I still have and is still working. I only wanted to upgrade to a better Sony product which has better still picture resolution. What a disappointment! I am buying Canon R800 instead.,1
17273,582,"This camera is worse then my old Sony camera from 2009. It is lousy video that looks like vhs and the sound is muffled. I loved my Sony camera from 2009 until someone knocked over the tripod and it broke. I tried this camera out in videoing the kids outside, & inside. The quality is just not there Sony I am really angry with your production of this camera. The videos taken were blurry and out of focus.",1
17274,583,Great camera ! Easy to use. Strengthens color automatically and focus is great !,5
17275,584,"Very bad experience. Now I understand why it is such a cheap camera, the quality is terrible, everything looks pixeled and very poor quality.
I bought it to be used on my vacation, with good light conditions (beach) and it still looks blurry. The zoom si useless if you have such poor recording quality.
The camera screen tricks you; looks good out there and when you download it on the computer you realize that you have recorded everything wrong. I do not recommend it. Very bad.",1
17276,585,This was purchased as a gift. The recipient appeared to love it.,5
17277,586,"Great budget camera, and I love the image stabilization and quality is really nice",5

17285,594,"Maybe ok for outside filming in bight areas, but for indoor settings i found the image quality to be very grainy. I'm surprised seeing as most cell phones can take a clearer video. This product also lacks any sort of flash which might have helped in lower light settings.",2
17286,595,Didn't know that it needed a memory card to work. but over all it's an ok camera,3
17287,596,This is a great video camera. The video is HD and the steadyshot feature is excellent.,5

17289,598,"The camcorder functions as I would expect. Picture is good but not great. I am VERY disappointed with the battery life. I bought this to record soccer games, and it can barely record one whole game before needing to be charged, so this is about an hour battery life! Not at all practical when you're on the road. I am very disappointed because usually you can expect better from Sony!",1

17299,608,Highly recommended. This camera does exactly what you want. Simple easy way to record.,5
17300,609,Model is older and not as nice as previous one. The lens cover needs to be manually opened and closed. Material appears light weight and cheap. I should have gone to Walmart.,2
17301,610,"Very disappointed. Picture quality is awful. I bought a sony camcorder a decade ago, which is much better than this one. Forget about recording a video or taking pictures in low light. Everything looks perfectly fine in the small screen. When you look them at laptop, it's grainy. No touch screen. You need to open the lens manually every time you shoot. Waste of money.",1

17332,641,"Good product ,worth the money",5
17333,642,Received wrong charging cord which makes me think that I received a returned item. I don't know how well the camera will perform until I get the new cord. Spent an hour on the phone with support. Not how I wanted to spend my evening.,1
17334,643,Good value . Records in AVCHD format,5
17335,644,"The camcorder & Focus Camera Co. is junk. The camcorder was cheaply made & didn't even work when I received it, then Focus Camera made me pay to have it shipped back. What a ripoff, don't buy anything from Focus Camera. They don't stand by their products.",1

Had to eturn the Camcorder.",2

17343,652,"Takes great movies, short learning curve",5
17344,653,Had to return it. Mine was either damaged or just very poor in quality. Reminded me of the quality that cell phones could record about 7 years ago. Quite disappointing.,1

17351,660,Very good camera. Love it,5
17352,661,"Bought it to use in my classroom at the end of the school year in May and only really started using it regularly in September.

17354,663,Simple & easy to use,5
17355,664,The quality of this camera is horrible. I have used cheap JVCs the last 10 years and never had issues. This camera struggles to focus and it's not even that clear when it is focused.,1
17356,665,Does not record in mp4 60fps so most software cant even see the videos. So maybe im just stupid. But its not a upgrade from my last cam. If im stupid somebody help me.,2

When I ordered this camera, but wrote the price of the camera as 1 lakh 90 thousand and gave me only ‚Çπ 94,900 / - in 50% of the sale.

If your need is for a camcorder based recording system, then you must consider the Canon XA 11. However, consider buying it from a retail outlet as the camera is much cheaper in retail stores. Over here the seller ProAudioVideo is selling the camera at 8k to 10k margin difference. So make sure you check for prices at a local store before buying from here.

Excellent manual control for professionals with Aperture control ring. Zoom is smooth and excellent focal range for the price. Shoots excellent Full HD 1080p @ 60FPS. Please keep in mind this is not a 4K camera.
Overall VFM Compact Professional Video Camera.
Bought it at Local Canon Image Square for 75k with Free Camera Bag, overpriced at Amazon.",5
17398,7,"I got it from a store in Guwahati at a lower price with an extra battery, charger, and a bag.
The stabilization is good, the canon color as always doesn't disappoint, it's very portable and easy to use.
The inbuilt microphone is also very nice but wouldn't recommend shooting without XLR mics or a 3.5mm mic indoors.
Zooming in and out is smooth with 4 zoom options, which is excellent as you can set its speed as per your liking.
You can charge while shooting too which is excellent for live streaming long events or church services.
I haven't tested the image quality but it promises a decent image.
Overall it's a great camcorder at a relatively low price. Earlier, I have used DSLRs and mirrorless for video shooting, and with this camcorder video shooting has become much easier.

I recently upgraded to the XA11, and it did not disappoint. It is a great go-to camera for serious videographers due to its audio capabilities and zooming options. I have tried using DSLR-type cameras but found it was hard to get those spur-of-the-moment shots. I call them my battle cams for sure. Its dual record option is great for making sure those one-of-a-kind memories are backed up and safe. I am sure I will be using this other camera for years to come.",5

I used for a few years shooting school plays, which you can imagine didn't have the best lighting and I had to shoot from the back of the auditorium, yet the video was crisp and clear. I especially love the instant auto-focus/manual focus button on the screen, that allows me to quickly refocus a shot and then turn back to manual.
You'll need to go into the settings to adjust the exposure for low light. Once you get to know the settings, you'll love this camera!",5
17406,15,"When held in hand (vertical positon), the LCD panel of this particular Canon XA11 videocam does not close completely when one tries to close gently. A second effort to wiggle-close the LCD panel door is required due to the poor alignment. Disappointing as no one wants to slam the delicate LCD to shut it. Worst of all, I had to buy another new one on Amazon to replace this unit--supplied by an Amazon third party seller. Even had to pay the return shipping first & then wait for Amazon to refund & reimburse me for the original purchase cost plus shipping cost. All this is a hassle indeed, holding up funds and preventing other purchases on Amazon!",2
17407,16," I chose the Canon XA11, because it features the best auto-video-stabilization in the mid-range camcorder game. If you'll be shooting on the move, this is the camera for you.

This Canon XA11 captures incredibly high-definition video in time-lapse (7 speeds), slow-motion (2 speeds) and multiple cinematographic recording options (make captivating content).

You can even take color-rich, wildly detailed still-photos with the Canon XA11. Check out the Blubonnet photo and you'll see how the camera's auto-focus perfectly captures the detail of the flowers at the forefront, then progressively slightly blurs the background to make the model really shine.

If you want to make compelling, interesting video (check out the time-lapse video attached to this review), get this Canon XA11. This is money very well invested.

Additional info I hope you find useful (see photo for what I connect to the camera):
‚Ä¢ Comica CVM-VP2 Super-Cardioid Condenser Shotgun Microphone ($189 - great sound)
‚Ä¢ Regetek 70"" Monopod-Tripod Adjustable Stand ($49 - trust me, don't go cheaper)
‚Ä¢ Altura Photo 160 LED Video Light ($36 - definitely get attachable light for this camera)

IMPORTANT: I chose to buy from this seller, because it is the USA version under warranty. Sure, this camera is found cheaper on Amazon or in giant bundles (with awful external mics and so-cheap-its-worthless add-ons); but those are international versions of the camera.",5
17408,17,"I purchased this camera in September of 2020 from Bestbuy and was very impressed with the quality, workmanship and overall camera performance!

I decided to purchase this exact same camera again to add to my equipment....except this time, I purchased the camera from Amazon!

The camera quality is clearly NOT the same. Parts of the camera feel like poorly recycled plastic and do not have the smooth finish of the 1st camera I purchased from Bestbuy!

In fact, the camera reminds me of one of those non-operational plastic prototype models! The camera performance so far has been on par, however I just did not expect the build quality to be so poor and obviously recycled plastic/refurbished product.",3
17409,18,"I haven't used the camera much yet, but it seems like a really great camera. The zoom is crazy good. The picture is great, and you can turn it to yourself to video and your arms don't have to be 10 feet long to make a good video. Excited to film more with it.",5
17410,19," I love this camera!!! I know it doesn't have 4k, but for what I do this camera is more than enough. It has beautiful color, works great in low light, and the 400 digital zoom is great!! I do a lot of outdoor run and gun videos, and this camera is solid! I wont buy any other brand, canons rule!!

This video is zero edits. Straight from the camera to the upload. üòâ",5

17412,21,"I had done research before purchasing 2 of these. We were looking for a good camera without breaking the budget for our church‚Äôs livestream. These cameras set bar REALLY HIGH. Our stream quality has improved 100% with these. The clarity you get even on a tight zoom is mind blowing. The way the color adjust to the lighting is awesome as well. If you are looking for a decent camera without forking out a lot of dough, look no further.",5
17413,22,"Canon has done it again. This is a great Camcorder if you are more experience than the beginners, and a little less than a experienced as a professional. Has a lot of bells and whistles I haven't even began to learn. I a getting back in to video recording from my video production days, and this camcorder is great. It I have only used it once, but picture was fine for night time shooting, and I was under street lamp.",5
17414,23,"Is very excited to get this camcorder. Some fantastic features like a long zoom. The problem came when the bread is a problem. And difficulty getting the sound the work. And help for the manufacture was nonexistent. In fact the bolt that is the for first-line support person frustrated me to the point of packing this backup put in the box and returning it after a week of frustrating attempts to make it work correctly. And then I did wind up with the product from the same manufacturer but one that had external support of many people using it so I can get the help I needed when I needed it. Had there been an alternative company for what I needed I most likely would've went with them. Overall I went with the DSLR and am very happy.

Have a great day",3
17415,24,"Took forever to arrive. No thanks to Canadapost The camera is super great and for someone like us who bought it for the use of the church and without prior knowledge on how to use camera, it is super super easy to use! Very user friendly!",4
17416,25,"I've owned Sony equipment for my entire life... Decided to try Canon for the 1st time in my life a week ago... It was a risk, but a risk that paid off! Absolutely love this camera! Build quality is an A+ It feels solid and not cheaply made. Video quality is also A+ I absolutely love the videos that come out of this thing! I do love the pretty easy to use settings layout they have going on. It's pretty simple and easy to understand. The touch screen is good. It's responsive and doesn't lag. As a lifetime Sony user would I buy Canon professional video cameras again? Yes!",5
17417,26,Camera has been install for a while now and works great. The only complaint is that the manual settings dose not save and has to be adjust each time its powered on. Otherwise great camera.,5
17418,27,"I bought this camera for hunting videos. Great in low light conditions. If you plan to use an external microphone, it has to be battery powered or phantom. No plug in only.",4
17419,28,This camera has great quality. Works well in low light. Super clear picture. Haven't tested the sound quality yet. But I will most likely use external mics when recording so that's not a big deal to me. I'm very pleased so far.,5

17421,30,"We really like this camera, just what we were looking for and the quality of the recordings is really nice.

Only down side,,, the microphone attachment feels a bit weak. Careful with that.",5
17422,31,So far I love this camera. The picture quality is amazing so far. I just wish I knew which way the XLR connectors were oriented before I ordered a 3 ft cable with a 90 degree connector that turns the wrong way and can't plug in. I can find other uses for the cable. Just trying to find the time to play with it.,5
17423,32,I needed to be able to record directly from our church's mixer board. I use the XLR terminals and pastor's voice records very well. The video quality indoors under fluorescent lights is very good. I've also used it to record (using the onboard microphones) chime performances and this works very well. One member gives benefit organ concerts that I've recorded and this works well except that the lower bass notes are missing.,5
17424,33,Still learning the camera. Used it twice. So far so good,4
17425,34,"It's FANTASTIC camera for any small-medium sized church looking for a professional grade live-streaming camera. We couldn't be happier with the picture or performance of the Canon XA11. Right out of the box it looks great, but it has tons of features for fine tuning. We also use this camera to record our video announcements. They have never looked better! It a small(ish) camera, but packs a major punch!",5
17426,35,"So far so good, I am a little disappointed in the low light color saturation. Not many demos of this thing out there. That said, I am thoroughly impressed with the zoom clarity and stability.",4
17427,36,"Perfect little run and gun camera. I do ENG, corporate, industrial, and interviews mostly and this is a little work horse, small but enough pro features for most pro videographers.",5
17428,37,"Working very well, the video is clear and the sound is good. It takes me a little long time to learn some new functions in this professional machine. Canon XA11 is the best video camera I ever used.",5
17429,38,Great camcorder with a ton of features. easy to setup and get started filming. I am using it to self film when I bow hunting. I have been wanting a Canon XA series for quite sometime. So glad I pulled the trigger.Awesome product! A great investment! BowHuntorDie!,5

17458,12,"This is a good model to start with, although it is still bulky from a user experience point of view. I think the cameras that are now coming on the phone are equally powerful as compared to SLR - I bought this to learn photography but to be honest, for everyday pictures, it is a lot more convenient to snap out your phone and take a high-quality picture. How Cannon can keep its relevance with SLR - it is a tough question to answer right now",5

17460,14," Announced on 10 April, Canon‚Äôs EOS 200D Mark II is also known as the Rebel SL3, EOS 250D or Kiss X10, depending on where in the world you live. The smallest and lightest Canon DSLR so far, it is targeted at entry-level users who want a more capable camera than their smartphone. Physically, the Mark II model is almost identical to the original EOS 200D, having the same sized body but being a couple of grams lighter.",5
17461,15,"A DSLR camera is as as good as the lens it comes with. I am not a professional photographer, but someone who likes to take good pictures! The first set of pictures I have taken with this camera was on a visit to a wildlife sanctuary. While taking a shot, it appears that the object is far off, even with zoom, but once the shot is captured, the picture comes absolutely clear and perfect! However for longer shots, Obviously one has to invest in costlier and powerful DSLR lens! Lighting with or without flash is perfect. I just used AF and kept shooting and I was absolutely delighted with the product!",5

17465,19,"Perfect DSLR camera for beginners and enthusiasts. 24.1 mega pixel Sensor, Digic 8 processor with Dual pixel AF and vari-angle Touch screen definitely a big plus to this camera.

with a combination of point-and-shoot simplicity, a Guided UI (user interface) to walk new users through the basics of photography, and a Creative Assist mode for more adventurous photographic effects.

The vari-angle screen on the back is excellent. You switch to Live View by pressing a button on the back of the camera and you can then use the touch control to set the focus point and change camera settings. It's sharp, colourful and clear and the touch response is awesome. Apart from the mechanical noise when the mirror is flipped up to enter Live View mode, this is just like using a mirrorless camera, as the autofocus response is just as rapid.

One thing I Don't understand why Canon Stores images only 72DPI while Nikon stores at 300DPI? Can any one explain this?

4K video is a big selling point on this camera, but you do notice a couple of limitations , there's a significant 'crop factor' in 4K mode, which means your lens's angle of view effectively becomes narrower. Any how, I am not much using videos.

Battery life is good and last for longer period.

Pros:
Very light and compact DSLR
Dual pixel AF
Great Live View auto focus response
Vari-angle touchscreen
Simple but effective controls
Builtin WiFi & Bluetooth.

Cons:
Only 9 AF points in viewfinder shooting.
Not compatible for 3rd party flash must go with Canon only.
No USB charging. No GPS.",5
17466,20,Nice product would have loved it if the 55-250 mm lens is included,5

17469,23,"My perfect DSLR got in 56k during sell on Amazon. It's my first DSLR and I'm pretty happy with it. Face detection + eye detection is just awesome. You'll get duel pixel auto focus with 1080p videos. Just loved everything about this camera.

Guided display:
- This is something great when you are beginner. Every action of yours shows you results.

Simple interface:
- As it's canon dslr it's interface is pretty simple anyone can learn in just few minutes.

Processor:
- It's all new digic 8 processor is really faster enough to capture great images out of it.

Bettery life:
- Awesome Bettery life in compare to older 200D. Can take almost double shot then older one in single charge.

Variangle Touchscreen Display:
- It's Touch sensitivity is really so good. You can do almost all function through its touch screen. Also it can be used to check frame while shooting youtube videos.

Wireless connection:
- This feature makes this camera best in this price segment. You can operate your camera remotely through Wi-Fi also can download images directly to your phone through Bluetooth/wifi.

Face detection along with eye detection:
- 200D II now offers eye detection while shooting videos which is 1 step ahead from older 200D. Must require feature in DSLR for videography.

4K video:
- In this price range its offers shooting in 4K which works great if you have wide angle lens.

Offers edit RAW:
- You can edit RAW images directly in your camera which is again great feature this camera offers.

Value for money:
- With all these great features in this price range i can surely say that it's a good value for money camera for specially for beginners.",5
17470,24,In our budget it is best camera,5
17471,25,"It only supports TTL flash, which will cost around 8000+ else u need to buy a trigger which will cost around 3500",3
17472,26,Nice for 200d mark 2,5
17473,27,"First DSLR
Works like a charm",5
17474,28,"A tiny body with marvellous brain.Auto focus is excellent but I only shot 93 pictures till date but hope it will satisfy.
For beginners it is a great learning tool. I have Nikon D 800E,D810 but they have no touch screen only D850 has. Canon in this price bracket provides touch screen .Canon has a legendary auto ISO function. In RAW file It will be have no need to touch ISO SLIDER. Color rendition is superb.Canon understands the Indian complexion well.Beginners can use every possible mode to gain experience.
Picture quality is extraordinary .Above all the lens is very good according to picture quality but build quality is not good with plastic mount. I used canon 350 D, 40D,50D,60D, 5D MK II but canon lenses are fungus prone the L series lenses were loaded with fungus. The cheap lenses deteriorate in image quality rapidly due to fungus infestation.
Overall it‚Äôs a excellent camera to begin with.
The service of Amazon is exemplary .The camera came 2days before but the advertisement showed the lens was 18-55mm f/4 I ordered it for that reason but the seller supplied me 18-55mm f /4-5.6 .It is a sheer breach of contract.",5
17475,29,"Excellent VFM, especially if you are getting the dual kit version. I had a 1500D and was happy with it but gave it away as I needed one with Wifi/BT support.

Canon EOS 200D II is an excellent beginner's DSLR. It's a Canon, so there is absolutely no compromise in the quality. The kit lens 18-55mm is decent for regular snaps, and the 55-250mm Zoom Lens is excellent for long range shots. The OS is easy to understand and within a few hours/days you will be fairly comfortable with the DSLR and would love to snap away. Attaching some samples.

However, I would strongly encourage you to get Prime lens. Either EF 50mm f/1.8 (excellent VFM at ~8.9k INR) or EF 50mm f/1.4 USM lens, and the 10-18mm wide angle lens.

Overall, Excellent APC-C DSLR which is VFM.",5
17476,30,Very good product for beginner..... Good quality product in this price segment.. .. Image quality is pretty good with 18-55 kit lens..... With 50 mm lens it will far better,5
17477,31,"Awesome camera in this budget..
Have lot of features though sometimes you may feel the 5fps is a bit slow when trying to capture birds of rain drops or something like that.
55-250 lens is amazing & you must buy that otherwise you will miss a lot of opportunities that you can get with this lens.

On YouTube everyone says this is light though as my first camera i didn't feel it is too light with 250 lens though i don't know how heavy other dslr are..
All 4 photos taken at 250 mm full zoom.. you won't get big moon with even 250mm, i think atleast 400mm is required.
Overall a great purchase for this budget..",4
17478,32,Received this product on proper schedule. But I was waiting for Rakshabandhan to click photographs. Till 10 August I was using basic 18-55 mm lense to click photographs. But today I decided to try clicking photos using 55-250 mm lense but I noticed white spot on lense and that was from inside. I tried replace the product option but executive was unable to help to return/ replace product considering price of the product. She escalated to his senior and even he was not helpful. She commited about return call by tomorrow and said she raised incident. But I didn't got any mail notification or not even incident number was shared with me. Tomorrow is the last date of returning product.,4

17480,34,This is one of the best camera for beginners.,5
17481,35,"I got it during the Diwali sale. The camera performs pretty well.
The screen and the controls are very user friendly, easy to get used to.
It also suggests you which mode and when to use them when you want to move away from auto.

As the lens provided is not of the range f/1.8 or below, the bokeh effect in low light isn't that pretty. But in daylight bokeh effect is really good while shooting portraits even with the kit lens.
Along with the kit lens, 55-250mm telephoto lens was also provided. It works well, the stability and auto focus of the shots is amazing.

The battery performance is really good. Lasts for a long time and charges quickly.
If it's your first camera and you don't want to buy older models, this DSLR camera is worth it's price.

I have added some handheld moon shots which are pretty stable, and other pictures i took on this camera.",5

Memory card is 16 gb only.... Hence need to purchase 128 gb for video recording purpose..",5
17492,46,"DSLR quality always depends on both body and lens. Camera body autofocus is great specially in the video. Easy to shoot cinematic videos as autofocus is too smooth. Coming to the lens it is just kit lens with aperture starting at 4, so don't expect razor-sharp image indoor. Up to 800 ISO, there is no visible noise. At 1600 ISO you will see little noise if you view in 100% the actual size of the photo. For 4x6 or 5x7 it will not noticeable. Just buy an additional lens, like 50 mm, and you will get awesome indoor and low light photos and videos. Camera is great in this price range.

17562,116,"Beyond the digic 8 hype, the dual pixel cam and a touch screen lcd, the pics are not that great.
My galaxy s9 plus shot better pics, atleast for me.
The camera cant be returned and only replaced that too only in case of a flaw.
The 18-55mm lens sucks and maybe 50mm stm prime lens is way better.
The flash is a manual lift up and not a automatic pop up which is big drawback.
The hot shoe does not have a universal pin so you have to buy an expensive canon flash only which is big big flaw.
Wouldn't recommend your big bucks on it .
Have sold it on olx but for a loss .",2

17751,5,"One of the best camera at this price range and it gives more than what it says.
The only thing the camera bother is it's extremely expensive lenses and monopoly of dealers to fluctuate the price of lens.
Thanks",5
17752,6,I will give feedback after assemble the camera,5
17753,7, Nothning To Tell What I Dislike In This Camera,5
17754,8,"Fabulous camera! Good for beginners and video shooting.
1. Mirrorless
2. Inbuilt flash
3. Tilt screen
4. Good image quality
5. Best for videos.",5
17755,9,"Excellent Quality, Excellent Packaging and Excellent on performance. I researched a lot on the internet before buying this camera. When the product arrived, I was amazed at how sturdily the product was packaged and handled. I had to use scissors and knife to cut the external packaging. The product came as promised with all items properly packed. Installed the battery and lens with ease. Installed the strap also with ease. Although I would recommend Panasonic to provide a thick strap with metal hooks. I would request users not to dangle the strap on your neck or shoulders. Always let your hand be on the camera also to prevent accidental falls etc.

I have shot some amazing cinematic videos and photographs for personal as well as corporate use. The camera has a user friendly interface and tells you via the red icon if the settings for a shot are not correct and then you can adjust the shutter speed and focal length and take the shots or video. The 4K video is amazing and gives you cinematic look. You can shoot videos in full color or in the Cine D or Cine V profiles and color it using color grading software. You are the boss so make whatever setting you want as per the content you are shooting. This camera makes videography and photography fun. It has Aperture priority mode for bokeh, Shutter priority mode for action shots. Long shots with long shutter speed. The factory supplied lens 14-42 mm is good enough because its both a close up and wide angle lens. Excellent quality and value for money.",5
17756,10,Need to change the lens in next upgrade,4
17757,11,Little bit late in auto focus but it's okay quality is good for beginners it's good camera finally this price frequency,5
17758,12,"Pros:
The build quality is pretty good.
Wifi connectivity and remote control.
4K video also has 60fps for slo-mo.
Kit lens, although it doesn't have great zoom gives good quality images.

Cons:
Autofocus isn't great, but I generally use manual focus so it doesn't affect me.
No pouch or memory card, you'll have to buy on your own(choose a memory card with enough space)
Inbuilt flash isn't great.

Overall is a very good camera for both photography and videography.",5
17759,13,This is micro 4th crop sensor camera.most affordable mirrorless camera in price. 4k video recording capable. Very compact and light weight.function and feature is like ton.definatly consider this camera if you are beginer or amature. You can use adapter and used canon/nikon lenses into it.,5
17760,14,,5
17761,15,"Being the first mirrorless camera I purchase, I find this too good. The picture quality, video, photos in the low light, continuous auto focus of the objects while video recording are too good in this cam. With its light weight and compactness, makes it easy to carry while travelling.",5
17762,16,It's my first DSLR. I am comfortable with this camera üì∑.. It's good for beginners.,5
17763,17,Awesome camera for beginners,5
17764,18,nice photos 4k viedo budget friendly have wifi connectivity light weight easy to carry,5
17765,19," The first photos that you are seeing are taken with the camera and with 14-42mm kit lens.......
This camera is definitely a very good camera for beginners....
This camera also performs good in low light even with kit lens
You need to bump up iso to 6400
A little noise can come
But that's not a big issue as u can fix that in post processing or in editing software
Also the battery backup is pretty good
As it last around a day with full charge and it takes 3hrs to charge

To get the most out of this camera
Use the following settings
Back dial- for exposure
Shutter dial- for respective control in the mode(like aperture in A or shutter in S)

Then use F1 button for auto focus
As it can come handy while using manual focus

Use F3 for digital zoom

And you can use the HYDN mode in bright sunlight as it has wider dynamic range and in some cases better skin tones (sometimes the skintones look worse)

I mostly use A for photography
And A in manual movie mode also,
Some photos of my settings are also attached.....",5
17766,20,"Good camera for vlogging.
4k video quality excellent.
Recommended to buy",5
17767,21,,5
17768,22,An excellent camera for budget price.No camera yet been made till today at this price. The cheapest and the best camera. Don't delay dear enthusiasts go for it immediately.,5
17769,23,"I think it's best for a beginner. Very smartly priced. Photos and videos come up exceptionally good. The lens which come along with the package is decent and enough to take nice pictures and videos. Obviously go on to higher price band you'll get much better cameras, but, as I said for this price it is a BEAUTY.",5
17770,24,,5
17771,25,I was a Canon user. Moved to Mirrorless for it's compact size.,5
17772,26,Lence,2
17773,27,"This is a great camera. It's a small form factor and I absolutely love how light it is and the pictures it takes just out of the box are amazing. However, the USB data cable that comes with it is Panasonic proprietary cable. Understandably this camera came out in 2015 so back then USB-C wasn't as common... so we're stuck with this weird cable that if you lose, the likelihood of easily finding another is so less. I lost mine and I am stuck unable to transfer pictures to my laptop from this... the SD card reader in my laptop is busted and until I buy a new (USB) one of those, I can't transfer pictures. Am I dumb? Yes. But is this camera also dumb? Totally.

2 year update:
Dropped it once on a tile floor and it broke. Sad. Back to Nikon, I guess.
2 year 1 month update:
Sent it to a Panasonic repair shop in Delhi and they fixed it for rupees 1180/- only. Great servicing by Panasonic. I've increased my rating to 5 stars.",5
17774,28,This camera is like 6 years old but still have the capability to shoot some great videos but with an appropriate lens....not that good for photography but still great camera....i've been looking to buy it for a long time and it didn't disappoint me....reading the reviews i thought i will not be getting any memory card or bag with it but when it arrieved it had both of them inside the package....i was happy to see that .....bought it for like 37k indian rupees........looking to achive some goals with it...,5
17775,29,Dont buy it for videos i suggest.. m basically a youtuber but somehow realized that i have wasted my money on this. Not recommended to the vlogers. As there is time limit in the camera which is hardly 16 mins. And lots of issues i had found.,4
17776,30,"Best for documentary film making. Best for beginners. Full HD video quality, 50 frame rare and smoothness is satisfactory. Also supports 4k in 24 frames per second. Standard JPEG mode photo is not so good but you can get high quality pictures with 4k mode, liked amazing 4k pre burst mode . It is the best camera in this price range.",5
17777,31,Great for photography and video.,5
17778,32,"It is the best camera available at this cost. I have an Online educational institution and I shoot 4 to 6 hours three days a week. It runs continuously for 89 minutes in MTS format without getting overheated. It has an external mic slot. I use a Boya condenser mic. And I get sharp voice record. The swivel monitor, face detection and panasonic image app make self video shooting easy.

LoLioscope editing app is paid. It doesn't offer even a free trial. Anyway I haven't tried it.",5

17886,140,"I bought this for Rs.47,000/- next month they made it Rs.35,000. WTH ??? Companies shouldnt just drop price so drastically that it ruins our investment. There should be a gradual decrease.

PLz note my following review is entirely based on video on this camera as i didnt buy it for stills. Only a fool would buy this for stills as for the same price you can get an awesome Canon/Nikon DSLR which will have a much larger sensor giving you lovely shallow DOF and color reproduction.

Anyway, this camera gives you 4K quality that can almost look like a Redmi phone's 4K recording. Horrible green tinged or bluish tinged footage. So bad is its inherent white balance and color temp handling. No amount of tweaking will get you out. Panasonic cant beat Canons color science and natural color that you get from Canon DSLRs. Dont trust all the YouTube videos you see etc. They have shot those in scenes where the bluish tinge adds to the appeal. But show me good skin tone shots with this camera. Very rare to see. Unless you invest in a very costly lens maybe.

Also in a DSLR, lets say you want to have a certain wide angle lens, say that lens for your DSLR costs you X amount. For the same effect (with no shallow DOF bec of its miniature sensor in the G7) and angle of view in the G7 the lens will cost 3 times as much.

Im planning to shoot myself for buying this utter waste of a camera. Only after buying it did i realize that the color tinge etc wont accomodate for all types of shots. Whereas in a DSLR you can do cool temp shots and lovely warm shots. The amount of noise in the video (color & luma noise dots on the video for laymen to understand) even in average and well lit rooms will drive you crazy. Especially with yellow pale walls and browns. The final will be murky and with rough noise in it.

How do i know all this. 9 years of experience in Photography & Videography. Trust me or not, dont ever buy this. You can go for a full frame or APSC size mirrorless camera instead from makers like Sony/Canon/Nikon etc.

Thanks for reading this. And wish you all a sensible purchase.",1
17887,141,"G7 is the best at the entry level segment with all-round options. Auto focus is a problem in all lumix cams... since we use manual focus on most of the part for videos OT won't be a problem.

17892,0,"Overall a good TV but majority of the apps that are available on smart TVs like VU which are readily available on Google Store, you cannot find it on MI TV. Once such app is pluralsight. Another issue is of bluetooth if you want to connect your Bluetooth audio everytime you have to pair it fresh.",4
17893,1," I purchased this 32"" Mi Tv on 25 July 2022 got two day delivery. This Smart Tv has its own pros and cons but **buy at your own risk as this model have high defective piece rate.**
*ùó°ùó¢ùóßùóò:- Rating is as per price point under Rs.15,000
After 1 month usage review:-
1. ùó£ùóúùóñùóßùó®ùó•ùóò ùó§ùó®ùóîùóüùóúùóßùó¨:- 10/10 as mentioned hd ready Smart Tv but plays 1080p content smoothly on YouTube, USB and no lag is encountered üòÉ.
2. ùó¶ùó¢ùó®ùó°ùóó:- 10/10 as mentioned 20W speakers are really sounds highüòÉ, also DTS system is good.
3. ùó£ùóòùó•ùóôùó¢ùó•ùó†ùóîùó°ùóñùóò:- 7/10 performance is just good enough as in this price range, I also installed PPSSPP v1-11-3 (which is stable version for Tv as latest version has storage issue) and played TDU using keyboard which run really smooth üò≤.
***But if you play video from internal storage and USB always the sound gets delayed after sometime üòï this happens on sometimes.***
4. ùóñùóîùó¶ùóßùóúùó°ùóö:- 2/10 casting is really waste üíÄ it lags a lot. But there is also a solution to cast your phone video, audio and image very smoothly using FastCast application üëå.
5. ùóõùóóùó†ùóú :- 6/10 HDMI is just fine also @1080p. But on pairing HDMI (I paired TataSky) it shows video not supported in the beginning but after changing low resolution on tata sky then 1080p it worked but most important thing ùêáùêÉùêåùêà ùêÉùêéùêÑùêí ùêçùêéùêì ùêíùêîùêèùêèùêéùêëùêìùêÑùêÉ ùêíùêéùêîùêçùêÉ (ùê¢.ùêû, ùêçùêé ùêíùêéùêîùêçùêÉ ùêéùêç ùêÅùêéùêìùêá ùêáùêÉùêåùêà ùêèùêéùêëùêìs)üòï this is because of MiUi ( really MiUi is untrustable UiüòíüíÄ) only one solution is to using audio cable (red and white cable) it also minimises the sound after some time. Overall HDMI experience is really bad üòí. And this issue is with a lot of customers I think even with all customers.

Will update after some time if encounter issue.
Overall:- 7/10 Risky Purchase.

Hope this helpüòÉ",4
17894,2,"If you want to purchase this Redmi tv. Go for it. I have being using this since 23 th of october I'm satisfied with this brand , under 30000 ‚Çπ 50 inches andoid is worth. Very big screen. My family loved it. Only voice recognization feel not working properly but if you don't say the word clearly how does it respond. Picture quality is amazing. Dolby audio is fav don't feel very low or very loud it feel cool when you hear the voice. For a tv the sound is best. Thank you Amazon for delivery",4
17895,3," I purchased this redmitv after comparing with many other brands and features especially comparing with redmi vs realme tv which comprises same features and nearby same price.Atlast i went with redmitv, because of patchwall but it devoid of google assistant as in realmetv feature...let discuss one by one feature..
Picture quality:4.5/5,color are pungent and hyper saturated but look amazing when u watch 4k video aa i had uploaded..Great to watch becuz of dolby vision and hdr10 features.
Sound quality:5/5, Sound quality is too good thanks to dolby audio and 30watt soundspeaker and this sound system also integrated to dts-virtual sound and dts-x and if you on this feature while watching, literally it will be great experience and Don't require extra speakers.Actually i loved the sound d way it generate and creates dolby atoms sound around u.
Features:3.5/5, I purchased this tv becuz of patchwall and i thought it will b helpful but notmuch helpful cuz u ll get updates of new release series or films but u won't get history of what u have watched in recent history in the subscribe app.u need to login i need to search for watch recent history.
2. I tried to connect alexa echo dot through sensy tv and mi home for wireless command(featured in redmi tv)but its not working so better if u want wireless feature command then go for realme 4k tv that also good option with similar budget.
3.U won't get any free air channel so you need to subscribe for zee5app,voot app, and hotstarapp..this was disppointing and its not true as shown in feature of redmi tv.
Overall i can give 4.2/5,i could have given 5/5 if alexa feature was working good, nevertheless its great 4k tv if you have 30k around budget,but still it lack some feature and need to upgrad for better experience..",4
17896,4,"I am writing this after using for it for more than a month. I got it around 26k which quite good deal for 50 inch. Following are the views on this tv.

Quite good picture quality for 4K HD video, specially for indian tv shows and movies, as it has saturated red color. As some of said brightness is not good in the tv and I feel that is TRUE and mainly affects when you are watching dolby vision or hdr content on netflix or prime video. With less brightness you will not feel something extra which a 4k tv must show. Dolby vision and hdr content are quite flat or say simple as normal HD tv on this. That might be common for most of the tv's in this range.
Memc or reality flow is just an marketing gimic and it's better to turn it off as it increase blurred effect. Sometimes There is hang issue on netflix only. Screen is reflective so if you have bulb or light opposite to tv it will reflect on the tv, so you need to turn off the light which is common in most tv's.

So if someone wants better dolby vision ready picture quality then go for some good qled tv.
I am not fan of Google voice recognition as it's not always accurate. So nothing new on tv.
Patchwall is not useful for me but live tv option is good and useful.
Sound quality is good enough for a room,may be not for big hall. I cant expect much more with sound quality when there is no in built soundbar. Different sound settings on the tv makes really difference so you can change settings.

No dolby atmos support atleast without soundbar, which was false specifications mentioned on the product details.

Turn on off time is OK and manageble.
Build quality is not that important as it always hangs on wall and practically bazeless design and with less bazele is same thing as without bazel screen has black outline and in slim bazel design those black area covered in plastic bazelss so just a matter of perception.

So far I can't comment on customer support as didn't required, but Amazon service was good enough for installation. 500 rs was charged for wall mount which I was aware already so no issues. Better MI should provide it in the box.
I feel MI should provide hot key for you tube on remote as it most watch app, because of kids.
Hoping this tv works for long time as my old tv.",4
17897,5,I purchased this on great Indian festival oct months it's awesome feature given by redmi but i thing is bad that installation charges they charge other amount so guys when you planning to buy make sure just clear your all charges doubt even if installation charges .

17957,65,"Here is my review incase you have any doubts:

All electronic items are having some pros and cons all together, even the reputed brands are not out of this reality.

Regarding this TV, it is a good TV which empasised on best picture quality with a decent pannel. Having all technical modules like HDR 10, 10+, HLG which are all together making the viewing experience a best one under this price range.

The sound is very loud and clear but lacking atmos control which may result in random echos during movies.

Buy without a second thought but always extend your warranty.

After purchase, you need to call the MI customer care for installation which is definitely free of cost. They will provide a good quality wall mount with a reasonable price (two options are available, one is fixed mount another one is moveable mount, price varies). Better to buy from them, than searching in the market.

17970,78,"I got this for around 19800 (SBI Credit Card discount 3000 + amazon pay balance + discounted price of around 28900 rupees during the prime sale). So all in all, I'm very satisfied simply because of the price I paid. If this is going to be your first smart TV and have not used premium products like Samsung, LG, Sony etc. before, you will be very satisfied. But for those who have used these products before, there is no comparison between redmi/mi TVs and any other budget offering and the big brands. The color is all wrong and build quality is pathetic. But remember, this is a budget TV. If you don't have the budget for Sony etc., Redmi is good enough. If you can afford it, spend a little more and get Nokia 4K Or even better, LG/Samsung.
Connectivity : you need to use a soundbar/home theater for this TV as the TV speakers are useless.. So connect the HDMI cable to the HDMI ARC OUT of your soundbar and connect the other end to the eARC IN on the TV. Then use another HDMI cable to connect the HDMI port from your STB/Tata Sky etc. to either HDMI 1 or 3 on the TV. This is for those whose soundbars are ARC enabled. Remember, even if your home theater is Dolby Atmos, (for which eARC is compulsory) you will not get true Atmos unless you have ceiling/overhead speakers. But the sound is quite good. I'm using the Motorola 4.1 AmphisoundX Dolby Atmos 250W Soundbar with the wireless sub-woofer and eARC on the TV and ARC OUT on the soundbar means I use just one remote for both TV and soundbar.

18053,161,"I have been looking for a budget smart TV from long time. I just wanted to try redmi 32 smart TV as it has become very popular and has service centres in my vicinity. I bought it for 12k.

After a 2 months of usage my opinion about TV are:
1. The picture quality is good but not as good as you find in relatively costlier tv of same brand or other brands like Sony or Samsung. You'll never notice this until you place other costly display side by side. I found out this when I screencasted my Manali trip videos from my OnePlus 7t to redmi 32 colours are more vibrant and appealing in my smartphone rather than in this smart tv.
2. Sound quality of TV is great to watch webseries and tv serials but for good movie experience or to watch great foreign web series with Dolby, you should get a good sound system. Don't get wrong notion about TV this is the scenario of every smart tv in the market.
3. User experience of smart TV is usually good. It has very minor lags or stuttering now and then. Don't install many apps as it has only 4.7 gb of internal storage(you'll get Netflix, prime, YouTube, YouTube music and hot star pre-installed). Try to keep 3gb of internal storage to avoid lags.
4. Remote is compact and light. It has dedicated prime, Netflix, hot star, patwall and apps(opens all installed apps) button. It picks up the voice commands clearly. It is advisable to go with voice commands instead of typing in all the applications.

Summing up the above words don't expect it to be par with 20-30K or above smart tvs. it is a basic smart TV with good features and good picture quality for the price.",4
18054,162,"Its a good product. I am using it from last 4 months. Picture quality sound and ux is very good. Only a single thing I noticed, after power cut it automatically get switched off. It take the invertor power after a glitch.

18127,235," Update:
Asked for the motherboard change as hdmi colorshift was clearly an issue with the TV and post the change the TV says MOOQ1 in about instead of MOOQ3 and seems the earlier motherboard was clearly incompatible with the panel supplied as all seems fine now.
WIFI is quicker to connect now as well and within one minute of booting the tv is ready to go unlike 3-4 minutes in previous case. Also the Software version on this one is a bit backdated at June 21 but I am happy to keep this as the October update on the MOOQ3 totally broke the TV software and made it slug. This one works perfect so far even with the new Android home screen.
I will repeat the point that only HD or above is worth on this TV and upscaling is better on native TV apps than on HDMI. Increased 2 stars due to prompt service, but well this is a metro so its ought to be.

Original Review Below:
If you want a device that doesn't stress you out when you want to de-stress, avoid this garbage.

Cons
*WiFi drops now after 3 months... Horrible app freezing issues esp on Netflix despite n factory resets
*The TV severely stutters and has to be restarted to get rid of freezing due to the poor RAM despite not having many apps installed and many disabled. Every time you power on and use netflix straight away you have to force restart to use it. Even for apps like cult live
*I will get my hdmi board tested or replaced after omicron wave, pretty sure it's dead as the color profiles are totally off, red looks pink and so on
*in built apps especially you tube over saturate white and contrast is shot badly. Fares ok for dolby vision on Apple tv and mildly for netflix hotstar. Hdr 10+ is bleh
*Pathetic soap opera effect, keep motion smoothing off
*Literally forced by the engineer to buy the wall mount
*WiFi takes ages to connect and let apps run
*Unoptimized software and minimal updates-seems like they launch forget and release untested upgrades as well
*Inbuilt or in tv softwares work well as long as you don't suffer the memory crunch. Optimize your Android setup xiaomi and do testing before releasing
*MI support is useless

Added a video of how badly it hangs with 0 background apps running. Avoid for long term use.

If you want peace of mind and a long lasting product avoid this at all costs.

Limited Pros
*Superfast delivery and open box inspection
*The fab exchange deal I got in Diwali sale was the only reason I bought this alone as a stop gap tv till I shift to the right fald
*Sound quality is nice for most apps and good enough for me not to look for avr remote
*Dolby vision support and earc support with hdmi 2.1,not that it matters, arc would have been OK even. Not sure if someone who affords atmos ht setup will buy this",3
18128,236," Picture quality and sound are good only.
Only major problem is horizontal line is coming in the middle of the tv. This is definitely a manufacturing defect. Further your installation person said there is no moving back wall mounting in Redmi and installed fixed mounting and charged Rs.900/-. On the Contrary, my son has purchased the similar TV 6 months back and got it installed with moving back wall mounting. Other than these two problems, tv performance is good. Line is a major problem., which will come generally in 10 to 15 years . I have sold my Sony tv, only for that reason and purchased Redmi.kindly do theneedful immediately",4

It been two months only as TV picture look vibrant , i didnt claim for panel replacement for now and hoping it is only a software glitch.

2. Audio is good after some update but remote button need to press for everytime to increase
you need to double press volume down button to MUTE it in case many are not aware.

3. Bluetooth is choosy and do not connect automatically to JBL speakers however worked fine for my headphones. I installed beach buggy game with joystick and it works smoothly. I also installed some retro console games and used redgear gamepad which worked quite well for contra etc.

4. Finally it is good if you get a good piece , however buying without extended warranty is not suggested as many seem to have conked off after an year of usage.

For value for money Yes at 27K value.
I'm rating after 5 months considering price with it's competitors

About product
>Body- Heavy,not that premium looking.
Have little gaps between screen and frame that cause dust deposition. Must clean frequently.

>Picture Quality - Good ,tested auto mode and customised than find the right one. Don't sit too close for better experience. 4/5

>Sound- 4/5 don't break at high volume.

>SOFTWARE-2/5
Good in starting but delays now. It's like taking time for engine to heat up üòÇbut than works fine. UI not actually lag it just delays in starting few min. Not. Freezing or hangs.
>connectivity-1/5 Perfect in starting but not not at all good and that's why i rated low i software coz that connectivity issue probably due to software.They can resolve by OTA update. For eg.
1)Cast feature now not working need a lot of effort it disconnects wifi and than i turn on and tap on cast connect,it disconnects tv from wifi
2) to connect your PC if u think of using VGA TO HDMIConnector but i came to know that they burn after sometime even if u buy expensive one.the solution for tht is use graphic card in pc and connect via HDMI to HDMI
3) Wifi connectivity is disappointing now like it will show saved on wifi name doesn't connect and you need to restart TV from power menu.
When u starting up from beginning like power off to power on in phones it connects ,but disconnect issue come while on running Setup box and shifting to TV/YT.(Restart is solution for now)
4)Voice recognition on Google assistant is not at all good. Don't know how to pronounce words for it's assistent
My mom's voice have better recognition (saying kanha ji k bhajan) me saying skyesports not recognised correctly

>>Accessories-2/5
Doesn't come with wall mount. got one from offline market at cheap price.
>Came with Stand which is not sturdy. It may fall.
>Will be more rated if they Give some update fixing the software and disconnecting issue (less chance for any or early resolution)
Overall 3.5/5 as a product and at <27K price 4/5 for a 50 inch chinese 4K LED.

Edit-That wifi disconnection is more pathetic now. Need to re-start always to connect else it's like "" connecting than show Saved"". Restart amd connects automatically.",3

18300,408,"This product is so amazing that it hasn't come out of the box only, thanks to amazing installation service and after sale services. After buying this product sequence of event is going to like this - You will buy the smart TV, schedule the installation, you will get a call from the installation but they won't show up that day. Then you will contact amazon customer care service coz there is no other option. They'll provide you a number and a OTP for the service guy. You'll call that guy, he will deny the service and say he doesn't have your installation on his service list. Then you connect with amazon customer care again, they'll tell you they have noted your problem and spoken to the team and escalated the issue. But you have to reschedule the installation again. Now, reschedule. Again you get a call in the morning and no one shows up. Customer care says they have escalated the issue with installation team. And, reschedule. This cycle keeps going on.

Moral of the Story :- They want you to install your TV yourself, This helps amazon and brand of the TV. As soon as you open the box yourself, warranty is void. If the product is faulty they can blame you for opening the box yourself and not waiting for the so called expert.

THIS WHOLE PROCESS OF DELAYING THE INSTALLATION IS TO MAKE YOU FRUSTRATED AND MINIMISING THEIR LIABILITY.",5
18301,409,"Good price for a budget 4K smart TV. For the average consumer, the image quality is pretty good! Obviously you can't compare it to a Sony or Samsung but it's good enough. I don't feel the need to go for more expensive brands. BUT you can definitely feel the cost cutting when it comes to the TV frame. Delicate plastics all around. Please be gentle when handling the screen. Not giving it a 5 star rating because I've been facing random crashes with the Netflix app.

Service centers are more spread out, so that's a leg up compared to other brands like Nokia, TCL, OnePlus, etc.

Inbuilt speakers are average. I would recommend getting a sound bar or home theater system to really take advantage of the Dolby audio.

It is not energy rated - this means it will suck up a lot of electricity.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you take a video of the unboxing upon delivery. Apparently you need it for warranty access. It is clearly written on the box - to be opened in front of MI service rep. You can confirm this with their customer care.

I recommend it.",4

18347,455,"Nov 2, 2021 : Redmi 32"" tv ordered on 3rd October delivered on 7th October.
Installation done by delivery executives only no seperate technician visit from redmi or any.

User of Samsung 32"" led tv from 2013 and a oneplus y series in another room almost a year. Bought this to replace Samsung tv in hall. As a comparison this is not up to the mark with both. Wall mount was old Samsung one so no extra accessories. Bought this at 12,221 with 400 cashback. Effective price of 11821/-.

Picture quality: not good but average. Black levels are not good.

Sound quality: the worst. I can't find any dolby settings as mentioned.

Software, UI : android tv 11 with storage of 3.56gb available out of the box. Lot of lag. Switching between apps takes a time of 10-20sec. Sometimes doesn't open at all. No ota update till date as mentioned for quick settings ( ota for tv or remote idk but quick settings not working).

Google assistant: works 5/10 times.

Network: though the router is in same room reception is not good. Signal strength and speed is less. One plus tv 2 rooms away has better reception on both 2.4 & 5ghz than this. Also i placed my Samsung tv with amazon firestick 1st gen on 1st floor even that has acceptable strength on 5ghz. Utter disappointed with this.

Energy consumption: i tested with wipro smart plug and on avg tv usage of 6-8hrs per day energy consumption ranges from 0.37-0.87. But with 1hr ott content 0.97+ observed this 5-6 times. So, who are planning to purchase only for ott beware about electricity bills. This is okay for families as most of the time setup box is used. So, 1star energy rated tv in 2021 is really con but some mentioned it as not.

Display & build quality: cheap quality plastic and discoloration with just a touch on display.

Conclusion: Consider this as entry level smart tv. Under 12000 its okay (even 12k is more i think ) but above that never consider redmi & mi for 32"" atleast. On comparison i prefer oneplus y series 32"" tv which i bought at 12,500/- over this.

Nov 3, 2021 : Yesterday i wrote my comple review and today i got ota update what a coincidence üòÖ. Update description
1. Improved picture quality 2. Improved audio quality 3. Improved performance optimization
Though i didn't find any improvements in above mentioned ota changes quick settings now available. Long press patchwall open quick settings finally. Other than that no other improvements. Lag increased. Update & installation took whole 40min with 200mbps jio fiber bb connection.",3

My gripe is all about how crippling the processor is. It takes a good amount of patience to switch between apps and get your media content going! And the software tends to get buggy, where YouTube refuses to open (absolutely no response when clicked on the app icon), or Hotstar crashing on boot. An occasional factory reset will solve these issues but its not very convenient to set up your apps and settings all over again, is it?

The built it in media player can register contents of my portable HDD, and can play video files of most formats without breaking a sweat. However, there is no way to display subtitles when used in this mode. That's an oversight from Xiaomi.

Also, the mic in my TV remote seems faulty as it doesn't register any voice commands. But I am sure that I will get it replaced under warranty.",4

18420,528,"The TV has average build quality which is expected. The Android tv performance is also average. Doesn't seem like a 2gb ram unit. However, all the features are there which makes it value for money.

Coming to display, it had an issue out of the box for Dolby vision content when horizontal scrolling black lines were visible bottom up when backlight is reduced or when viewing Dolby vision content in which case backlight is adjusted automatically. Got this fixed with a firmware update from Mi service centre. Stillt he HDR performance is average for content which favours dark atmosphere. There are somuch noise appearing in the picture. I observed this while watching Daredevil on Netflix. But this is okay considering the cost for me. Bright HDR content looks good. Otherwise picture clarity is awesome. I feel there is enough backlight to watch indoors. Panel is a bit reflective though. Overall I would say awesome value for money tv provided no major issues pop up.

Update:
Even though the horizontal moving black lines were fixed by Firmware update from service centre, it is still present maybe about 10% of what it used to be. It is only visible in 1 out of 1000 frames with some particular background colors while watching HDR content and only if you look closely. I feel it's not an eyesore as it used to be earlier and hence acceptable. It's not moving as fast earlier as well or not moving at all. Not ble to tell because the frame changes in video and you can't see it anymore. Not sure what these lines are!!!",4

18436,544,"Got my Redmi x50 delivered. Here are my first impressions after 1 day of usage.

Pros
1.) Upscaler is great. TV upscales the basic 720p and 1080p content really well and it's no less than Sony x-reality chipset. Even my old PS3 looks great on this TV. Also tested Base PS4 and it looks gorgeous. Ensure you enable HDMI 2.1 so u can enjoy HDR on consoles.
2.) Os is lag free and setup was fast
3.) MEMC is not in a separate chip but is software based but it's good for sport content or documentary videos. Don't use it for movies though as it gives a soap opera effect. Also don't use it when gaming as it will make your games stutter and lag.
4.) TV switches to game mod when you put a console and it reduces input lag.
5.) Display quality is great for the price. Company does not mention it but Brightness is around 250-300 nits and it's bright enough.
6.) Sound quality is good enough for a bedroom. If you want to put it in a a huge hall. U will need a soundbar
7.) Extended warranty of 1yr can be purchased for just 999 extra.

Cons
1.) U can't adjust brightness contrast etc while using TV as there are no buttons in remote to do that. You need to come back to patchwall screen and then adjust TV settings through android settings. It's a huge problem and because of this color calibrating this TV is a huge pain.
2.) Customer care has been a pain trying to facilitate installation. I had to escalate and raise complaint and then too they had no idea when engineer will come for installation. Finally installed it myself. Engineer came later and took pictures of installation to register my warranty. If you install it. Make sure to take full video of unboxing and installation.
3.)HDR leaves a lot to be desired. If you have seen real HDr displays then u know how HDR separates the dark and light areas. This screen does not do that really well. So don't expect too much from this. But I guess it's why it's cheap.

Overall for this price range it is a great buy. If you can spend more, go for Samsung Crystal series. The customer care is much better and overall HDR quality of Samsung is better too. Though u will pay 50% more, the HDR quality is worth it.",4

18490,598,EACH AND EVERYTHING WAS MORE THAN OUR EXPECTATIONS.,5
18491,599,"I previously own a Mi 32inch 4A Pro model.
I had purchased that TV as a stop-gap solution but ended up using it for almost 2 Yrs as it was quite good and satisfied all my requirements except the screen size. There wasn't a single issue with that TV during the course, so, when it came to buying a 50 inch TV I couldn't really keep Mi / Redmi out of the list.
After doing a bit of research, I zeroed in on Redmi x50 and Mi 5X. Mi 5X was costing almost 10K extra and I couldn't find enough reasons to spend 10K extra for that. So, finally went with this 50inch TV during the republic day sale and I must say that this is a complete value for money.

Picture / Video:
It shows any 1080p / 4K content exceptionally well. The colors are good and I didn't observe any saturation as such. Although reviewers are criticizing it for having low nits (around 250) brightness. I didn't find it that low and the brightness levels are pretty good. I think unless you have that eye for brightness, there is no issue as such.
When it comes to upscaling the normal setup box non-HD content, it does Ok Ok. Not great and not terrible either. Keep your expectations lower. In my case, I subscribed to HD versions of all the channels we regularly watch, so, life is good now.
Android TV experience has been great as usual. The whole SW stack is reasonably faster and does the job perfectly fine.

Audio:
The speakers are good for this ""price range"". Don't expect high bass or any fancy features. All I can say is that they do a pretty good job. For anything extra, go for a soundbar.
My old Mi TV had issues with Bluetooth in the sense that connecting any Bluetooth headset always has lagged in the audio. This is not the case with this TV. You can connect your high-end Bluetooth headset and watch movies without disturbing others in the house. There is no lag and everything works perfectly fine.

Overall, I would say, this is a perfect value-for-money TV with the most sought-after features. If your budget is around 30K and looking for a 50inch TV, just go for it.",5

18527,635,"The Redmi 43 inch FHD tv is a good buy for its price. Could have been the best one if it had more storage and RAM.

Screen quality is good, however there is no mention about the type of display it uses. The one I have received has good wide angle viewing and am happy with the overall quality.

Sound quality is decent but while watching a movie the volume increases whenever music plays but have whenever dialogues are being spoken the sound is low. Have to keep adjusting the volume levels everytime this happens.

The tv is powered by Android TV which allows one to install apps however this particular model comes with low 8GB internal space and most of it is occupied by the os and also the patchwall interface which hasn't been much useful for me.

Also 1 GB RAM is too low given that it sometime utilizes upto 80% which makes the apps hang many times.

Have faced issues with MX Player TV very frequently. While using memory boost and optimization helps to some extent, the app freezes quite frequently. The TV has also restarted a few times on its own after getting hanged while watching YouTube. Maybe an additonal 1 GB ram would have helped to avoid these problems.

Build quality is decent but light weight. Remote is also nice and is a bluetooth enabled one with inbuilt mic for using voice search which works well.",4

18566,674,Writing the review after 6+ month of use paired with a good 5.1 sound bar. No issue with the tv or the installation. The only minor issue is with the display panel. It's not bad but not perfect. Thus not giving 5 star. You can experience little warmer tone in 4k HDR. But it's not a dealbreaker. U can surely go for the buy,4

Pros-
*Good display with smooth experience.
*No lag in performance.
*Quick Start.

18580,688,"I like this TV overall but it has one aggravating habit - unlike every other TV I've had, it turns off when the power switches between the supply and the inverter and visa versa. You then have to turn the TV back on & then it goes into searching for the wifi & then you have to get back to what you were viewing.

The fiber router and every other device I have manages just fine without switching off.",4

18605,713,"So I ordered this tv on 13th feb and got it delivered by 15th feb monday. #1 The quality of the product didn‚Äôt meet the expectations i had after researching it‚Äôs reviews by amazon buyers and YouTube content creators. Youtubers and individual reviewers repeatedly preached about the picture colour brightness while comparing it to other same range TVs. But it‚Äôs after experiencing the tv screen right in front of my eyes that i noticed the colours were bright, but not as premium, realistic and satisfying as expected. So please don‚Äôt just notice the colour quality but do consider the quality of experience you get while comparing it with other TVs. #2 major default i found on my tv screen is.. if you increase your phone brightness and carefully notice all corners of the screen, you will see a slight black coloured faded tint which overtly conveys that the display quality is absolutely not premium. It looks cheap and fragile. #3 The bezel of the TV is slightly pulled away from the display panel and a white gum/powder like substance can be seen as I‚Äôve shown in the picture below. Again, cheap build quality. #4 Even though the TV supports android 11 but that literally doesn‚Äôt favours the processing smoothness while it comes to switching through apps, going back to the home page and restarting the tv. It takes time and is noticeably laggy. Maybe it‚Äôs the low quality processor and not android 11. Bottom line of my personal review.. the product didn‚Äôt reach my expectations after all the research, display panel & build quality seems cheap, processor is laggy, overall product is overpriced. I have reported a replacement for the issues regarding black tints on the display corners and the white gum that‚Äôs visible between the bezel and display panel. I will update if amazon replaces the TV and i get a clean display screen. Thankyou",3
18606,714,"I bought this a few days ago after a lot of searching.

Pros:-
1. Speed:- one of the main reason I went for this tv is that it has 2gb ram as opposed to most of the others which only had 1 or 1.5gb. my old TV had a 1gb ramn and it was painfully slow and very frustrating to use. Very happy with the performance of this tv.

2:- picture quality:- is bang on, if you have been using a 2k tv you can instantly see the improvement in picture quality.

3:- storage space:- it has a decent amount of storage capacity.

Cons:-
Sound:- I felt it's a bit lacking in the sound quality.

Remote:- feels like they should have had a few more functions.should have kept a seperate button for mute. It's annoying to contol in just 1 button.

They should have also given the wall mounts.
Overall, a 43 inch 4k smart tv for 28k rs is a pretty good deal.",4

-Good Value for money product.
-Adequate connectivity options, 3 hdmi (hdmi 1 is ARC), 2 USB, 1 3.5 MM audio jack. WIFI, Bluetooth
-Thin bezels
- Build quality is decent and it's light weight
- Patch wall UI is nicer then stock android
- Decent Picture quality and Sound - Apperently Xiaomi has better service network then real me or one plus.
-Bluetooth and wifi built in Chromecast built in
-Very good video quality
-Rich sound output Google assistant key in remote
-The TV really justifies its price. You cannot compare this TV's feature with high end TV of Samsung and Sony that is absurd.
-Video Quality is quite great just that when you view from an angle the intensity of colour changes which is fine concerning the price of the TV
-Sound Quality is awesome. It has 20W dual speakers which is quite great and once again don't compare it's speaker with high end TV having Speakers like DJ's Please.

Conclusion: If you are planning to buy particularly this TV go for it. You wouldn't regret. Actually even I was confused among 2-3 TV while I was making an order but eventually I choose this and I'm quite happy with it. Tick Tick ""Purely Honest Review I wasn't paid by Mi or Flipkart to write this elaborated review"". I'm writing this elaborated review because the buyers who are coming over here to make the purchase should get proper info regarding this TV and they should not have any confusions which I actually faced earlier.

Many online reviews says brightness is low as compare to others but does not feel at all. Picture quality, viewing angels are very good. Screen is having reflection its not anti reflection hence if there is windows or any bright light from external source then it affect viewing experience. Sound quality of inbuilt speakers are ok. Base is not punchy at all sound is having loudness but when you listening to dialogs and you set volume level and then whenever some music starts it gets much more louder than expected hence have to keep playing with volume levels(Sometimes it depends on App as well). Installation was done on next day from third party. Sometimes remote response is laggy once in 100 times i will say. Wifi many times gets disconnect or take too much time to get connect.",5

18661,769,"MI sells TV with 1 year warranty, and when I have started facing problems with TV after 8 months of usage, as there were a few white spots started coming in the TV, I had raised a complaint with MI support. Their serviceman came and verified everything and then said there is an issue with panel and it would needs to be replaced. However, MI RTTS team has canceled replacement with reason that it's a water issue.
TV is wall mounted in a secure dry place, there is no leakage of water anywhere near TV, still my replacement was rejected.
What is the point of having warranty if MI rejects replacement without even checking the component.
Rejection for replacement happened only by looking at photos and videos submitted by MI service person. Even service person was not sure that it will get replaced as he didn't see any scope of external damage to TV.

Pathetic customer service by MI. Really disappointed.

Update:
After a couple of follow-ups with MI and with a new service request, MI has replaced the TV unit with a new one.
Amazon Customer Support has helped and provided better guidance during this fiasco.",3

The sound quality is amazing. Sometimes, I felt like a bird was really chirping near my house, I then learnt that it was the TV.
The remote is minimalistic and works really well.
Android Home vs PatchWall is a bit too much for the TV to handle. It takes a long time and sometimes, it just ends up restarting the TV.
To be honest, I bought this TV because it promises 75+ free channels. But, that's not free, you need to subscribe to multiple apps to get those free channels. This was a huge let down for me.",4

Bass is non existent, I have heard better bass from small Bluetooth speakers from Sony, JBL etc. The 20W Dolby and DTS gimmicks do not translate to good sound. It sounds thin and there is an irritating hiss around the higher frequencies. I am not expecting hifi sound from any flat panel given the physical limitations but this is quite unbearable and several of my family members commented on it. And this is not a defect because I have heard the same crappy sound on their larger TVs at a friend's house. I thought I would compensate using a sound system.

only i find the issue with wifi speed look like very slow and low signal reception ( may be a Bluetooth interference ) apart from that i don't find any issue so far and i will update the status after 1 month of usages

No bluettoth connectivity and no voice search option though u get that in high end models in this same brand but other brands are giving this at this price point

18901,9,"Before buying this product , i have searched a lot as i have enough knowledge about the TV so choosing any brand , i gave preference to features with no compromise with quality that's why samsung in my list , i was looking others brand like toshiba which also provide great features
With good quality display , i was more concerned for display quality rather than features after all you have to enjoy display first , samsung is little costlier than other brand in this range but some time you choose best to compromise price or other thing that's why I choose samsung for its picture quality and believe me it is best
I m writting this review after testing or watching it for 15 days , it made me satisfied. Easy conectivity, easy installation

Good picture quality.
Con:
No Bluetooth
No 3.5mm audio out : You can neither use Bluetooth speaker nor cheaper sound bar since sound bar with Optical input support is costly.
Voice search not available : How a TV can be smart, if it is unable to listen and respond. Exploring You tube is pathetic.
Mini keyboard not full functional: Mini keyboard's key does not support in ""You tube"" for searching hence cant search even by typing.
Overall, my suggestion is avoid TVs, those have no Bluetooth and voice search support.",3

19089,197,"Bought Samsung Smart TV 32 Inch with Voice support Model No: UA32TE40AAKBXL) (2021) at Rs 16,700/- after all discounts during sale. Review after 2 weeks of usage:
Received the item on Jul 26 and engineer came to install on Jul 27. Delivery, package and installation all was smooth.
Pros:
1. It contains all the possible connecting options, USB (1 slot) , WiFi, Bluetooth, HDMI (ARC) (2 Slots), LAN, Optical audio out, Cable port, AV port.
2. Smooth, lag free and fast working, quick on and off within milliseconds. (Earlier I used Mi Smart TV which used to take between 30-60 seconds to start everytime.
3. All application works smoothly except Voot (it works very slow).
4. Supports all 3 voice assistance Bixby, Alexa and Google.
5. Supports screen sharing from laptop.
6. Has got some inbuilt apps for Apple users (not for me).
7. Works best pairing with Samsung phone
for screen sharing, remote control, smart things, audio mirroring etc.
8. No complaints with picture quality, color, contrast, sharpness etc.

Cons:
1. Despite 3 voice assistance, none of them works well if I compare with Mi (Google Assistance). For eg, if I give a command ""play Kishore Kumar songs"" from home page; it says no supported app and opens up an app store to download Gaana app (when I have Spotify, YouTube and preloaded music app installed & logged in).
2. It works on Tizen OS (doesn't support Android based apps/Google Play Store.) Means access to less and limited applications (Couldn't find Discovery till date). Moreover the UI also takes little bit more time to get use to.
3. Sound output is not that good compared to Mi. Most of the time I keep the volume above 40 while I never went beyond 20 in MI. Sometimes I feel the need of extra speakers while watching movies during day, which I never felt while using Mi.
4. You don't get any stand in the packaging. Engineer will bring only 1 stand free of cost (either wall stand or table stand) as per your requirement discussed on the call. Means in future if you need another stand, you will have to purchase it (seems like a cheap way of cost cutting eventhough you are paying more for a brand). Moreover, you cannot watch your TV untill the Engineer visit (because you don't have a stand).",5
19090,198,Nice product,4
19091,199,"I had a good experience buying this TV. People are complaining about it's Bluetooth description. Yes it has the Bluetooth but for the screen mirroring purpose only. You can't directly connect a Bluetooth device to the TV.
About installation and service -
I had little problem with installation appointment. Samsung did not call me for installation so I booked an appointment by calling their customer service. They have arranged the appointment by my schedule.
But if you want easier procedure, here are few steps-
1. Call the local Samsung service center or find out the Samsung service guy for your area and contact him.
2. Discuss about your online purchase with them and they will give you detailed information about everything.
3. If you want to exchange the old TV and you can't do it here on Amazon (I couldn't because of my location) just let the local service center know about it and they will buy your old TV by their valuation.

About resolution and sound -
If you want HD resolution you need HD set top box and have HD channels.
For better sound there is optimized sound option which amplifies the sound enough.
If you want to connect Bluetooth speaker to the TV then you can go for Bluetooth transmitter which you can connect to your TV and then connect any Bluetooth device.
There is no AUX cable provided with TV. You'll need to buy it separately.
Buy a stabilizer along with TV to protect it from electricity fluctuations.
TV has the port to connect your laptop, pen drive and home theater system.
I hope this is enough information before you buy!!",4

 This is my initial impressions. Will update with a detailed review after some time with the television. I would suggest that you go with the UA32TE40AAKBXL 2021 model and not the 2020. The 2021 model has Bluetooth and WiFi 5Ghz. The complete feature set including the availability of apps in the app store will be updated with the detailed review.
Some initial impressions:
1. The picture quality is good but only for movies. Lack of good resolution is visible in the 32-inch screen.
2. This is not suitable for a permanent monitor use case. The sharpness levels and text readability are not good which is one of the primary objectives of a monitor.
3. Screen mirroring works with Samsung devices, Apple airplay and laptop. Other Android devices not tested.
The screen gets fully covered only when mirroring a laptop. After mirroring the sound is from the TV (tested with Youtube though from the laptop). Mirroring from PC has an audio lag sometimes and flickering picture due to lag.
4. The booting time is very less. Please see demo video for that.
5. The remote is not suitable for old people who are used to many buttons.
 6. I could not properly set the TV with Sity cable. The cable TV remote is required. Universal Remote not working with Sity.
7. The sound is idle for a living room. Will not replace a good speaker but decent enough.
8. The energy rating is 2 stars with a rated power consumption of 67.42 kWh/Year.
9. Samsung servicemen were prompt and installed the wall mount(not in box) without any additional charges.
10. I bought this for around 16800.
11. The TV has 2 HDMI ports and one USB(the version I am not sure about).
Television makers should part ways with 720p screens on TV as in slowly becoming the case with mobile phones. It looks bad on a mobile phone let alone a 32 inch TV. Except that I am satisfied with my purchase. So far so good.",4

19116,224,It is a budget smart tv with only few standard features where it should have minimum of two USB ports. Basic feature like Bluetooth connectivity is missing on this 2021 model but this was found on another 2020 model. Samsung should have offered full HD Smart TV models on this price range. Samsung was providing 22 inches TVs with Full HD LED display (Model #: 22F5100-a) earlier which i purchased on 06th Sep'2015 for rs11490. I see Full HD series only on 40 inch TVs and beyond these days. Product came with wall mount stand is an added advantage.

19126,234,"This TV is shipped without tabletop stand or wall bracket. It is intentionally done to avoid customers installing the TV by themselves, as it can lead to warranty claim issues. Received the TV and waited for 4 days for Samsung service to bring the tabletop legs. Picture quality is as good as any other 32 inch LED TV but sound quality is very poor, not even a trace of bass and equalizer is disabled(greyed out). This substandard flat sound negates all other good aspects of this TV. Apps worked fine, no glitches observed.
Note for other buyers: TV comes with brightness set to max, reduce it by 20% if you want longer life for the panel, trying to avoid the possibility of early backlight failure.",3

19145,253,"Really good tv, the UI is pretty smooth and easy to navigate. Boot time is really low. It wakes up really quickly, whether you it turn it on by remote or from the switch board, fastest that I've seen in this range. Picture quality is good, blacks are nice. Audio is great as well.

However, what I didn't like about it is that Samsung didn't ship a table mount in the box. I had it mounted on a wall, but it would have been great to have the option of putting it on the table as well. You can do it, but in that case Samsung technician would not provide you with a wall mount. It's either this or that.
Also, app availability in good but there's no Discovery+ app available on this tv as of yet. All other apps are available.
Voice assistant also works well but now after using it, I've realised that it's an useless feature and one can do without.",4

But only one item ,, either table stand or wall mount. All other companies provide table stand for free with in the box , but samsung will cheat you . They will not provide the table stand for free....",2

19155,263,I ordered the TV and installation for it. Did not pay attention and now realises that there is no stand with it. There are so many reviews about stand not provided but somehow skipped the attention. Now I am facing the difficulties of getting a stand. The Samsung nos are useless and not able to go through them. A chatbot with a silly attitude (which means a customer query is not at all resolved and you are shutting down ) is not a solution. Feels irritated,2

19160,268, Tv stand is missing,3
19161,269,LED stand is missing in the package. So what kind of negligence is this?,4
19162,270,"Shipped with the amazingly worst and wonderfully most unreliable courier of all -'Delhivery'. Never calls or texts, but updates that they attempted and failed. Had to fetch the package from them by myself. Hence, seven blessings to me, the 'Home delivery' was graciously and miraculously turned to 'Self pick-up.'
Now, to make things more interesting, it doesn't come with a stand or wall mount. The engineer/installation team is supposed to bring it. After 1 week of delivery, despite promising every single day of providing the installation service before 8pm, it never happened. Then, as a bonus, they refuse to provide the contact information of the installation team. In this age of technology, I'm pretty sure that majority of the customers can install the TV by themselves, so Samsung felt the need to complicate that by not providing the stand or wall mount in the box. It's like your wife just gave birth to a good-looking baby without legs. Oh, Jolly! The baby has no legs! The TV has no stand! What a joy! Inner peace! Merry Christmas! Let us sing! Let us dance!
What am I supposed to do? Let my grandpa hold the TV for me while I sit back, relax, eat popcorn, and watch the TV? Thank you Samsung, for the wonderful unreliable service and the fantastic ridiculous policy. The TV has been lying useless for a week, just waiting for your hyperactive A-team to come and install it. I'm gonna return the product before I miss the return window because ""Prevention is cure than beterness.""
Jai Hind!

Update: Return was not allowed. Even to return, you need a job sheet from the installation team. You can't use the TV because the installation team won't turn up. You want to return the TV because the installation team won't turn up... but you can't return the TV because the installation team won't turn up. It's like making a deal with Dormammu.
The engineer finally turned up after a long time and provided the stand.

 Got it @14,999 . Amazing Product but unlike other brands which provide 3 Yrs warranty on panel, Samsung provides only 2 years of warranty on panel. Voice is Loud and Clear, Picture Quality is Not That Good if you look from very close angle but what can you expect from a TV that supports only 720p Resolution. One thing which really disappointed me was : No Bluetooth Support. In today's time how can you call a TV smart if it doesn't even have bluetooth. Even cheap rs. 500 keypad mobiles have bluetooth. Plastic Quality is OK but don't compare it with Rs. 40,000 - 50,000 Televisions. You can't tell the difference anyway just by looking. Cord length is Short and the UI is User Friendly but not smooth when compared with FireTV. My advice if you're in the Market only to buy a TV that can run YouTube and other OTT Content and you sit far away from television then buy it. Otherwise when you find your Dream TV in this Price Range, Please Let me know",3

No sound coming from tv.
PICTURE QUALITY IS GOOD.
smart features as expected are good.
I ordered it on 19sep and it was delivered on 21sep and the technician came on 22sep and then we found that sound is not coming from TV.
He tried all reset settings and factory reset settings but still the problem persisted.
Then he suggested me 2 options.
1) They(Samsung,) open the TV and will rectify the error
2)To return

As it is a brand new TV and I thought to return.
I have put request for return and then Amazon customer care contacted me and he said that an Amazon technician would visit and he himself gives a report and then they will consider replacement.so he ordered inspection service and it was scheduled for 24sep but on 24th morning I received a message that inspection service order was canceled.Today ie on 24sep I have again put the same return request and again the Amazon customer care called me and I explained him everything.He said he once again put inspection order and it is scheduled again for 25sep.
I hope he comes.

It was a surprise for me.I have been purchasing online since many years but a product like TV,a defective one?
Didn't expect this and I hope it will be rectified soon

The technician visited on 25th sep and again customer care person contacted me and he said TV will be replaced on 29th sep.He said the same person will bring a new TV and he takes back defected one.
I got replacement on 29th and got fitted on 30th sep.

I bought a 32inch television which was delivered on 4th October. Post delivery today is 8th October and the installation is still not done. PFB the sequence of events:
4th October - No call from service centre/technician
5th October - No call from service centre/technician
6th October - Technician comes home after multiple calls to the toll free number. Technician comes without a table stand/wall mount. To be specific samsung doesn't provide these with the television, these were to be provided by the technician.
7th October - Calls to the toll free number multiple times during the day and I was assured that the technician would come. No one came

Today is 8th October as I am writing this. I would not be available at my residence so the demo installation(if any) would need to be done on Monday, ofcourse if it is in line with the whims and fancies of the service centre/technician.

And all along this time I have been getting messages that my service request is pending because I was not contactable.

Usually I prefer not going for lesser known brands only for the after sales service. This time the behavior of samsung is outrageously worse.",1

Really? Why this information that TV Wall Mount costs Rs 1,000 & TV Table mount costs Rs 1,000 & only TV installation is free, is missing from AMAZON product page. Then this AMAZON site information is incomplete & is a case of unethical , malpractice of extorting easy money from customers , post delivery of TV by whom? Samsung or Amazon, you decide.

Picture clarity is as good as it gets with 720p screens. You will need to change couple of settings when it starts fresh but rest all is just fine.
I have a Sony Bravia which is 1080p. And Sony is better in every segment as it comes with 1080p resolution plus bravia Engine but Samsung is very well designed and offers a good enough package when compared to Sony. Sound is great as well. Tizen OS is smooth and gives you great experience, the only problem here is, you don't get many apps. Choices are less. Amazon firestick offers more apps.
I don't know why but Remote which comes with TV is not same for everyone. Possibly there are 2 types of remotes, 1 with that Circular button which has very less buttons. Where in which I got has too many buttons on it, this buttons are so small, it's a hassle to type with them. Believe me you will get irritated to use the remote in night when lights are off.
You can control the tv somewhat with mobile app that samsung provides. It's pretty nice and the UI is well developed. But all you can do is change apps, close, volume control and tv on/off. You can't control inside of any app.

Built quality is good. Parts are tough. Samsung will provide installation free of cost for wall mount.

Since there is no stand in the box, the installation person is supposed to bring that but despite telling the Samsung guys, they came without table stand. After more than 10 calls to Samsung customer care , Amazon, Samsung local installation still pending. Amazon customer care seemed to have no control over Samsung for speeding the process.
Reason that was told was that Samsung doesn't have table top stand.
Better go for tv which has stand in box so that the process is simplified.",3

Amazon service was good with open box verification, Picture quality and sound quality was decent infact I had to lower the sharpness and brightness a little. Tizen OS was smooth and it was comfortable with 7-8 tabs open in the browser. Was able to connect my remote machine and work easily with keyboard and mouse connected via USB. Connecting with my wifi enabled speakers was smooth and hassle free.

Only issue i think were the limited apps available in store compared to Android they were too less and not of much use. But I think it will improve over time.",5

During the week we thought it was our ignorance with settings. By the time we realised that it's a fault, return window was closed. Technicians came on 12th June and stated that this piece will be replaced as it had some manufacturing fault in sound section. Since then we are waiting for new TV to come. Customer care will keep us on hold for long sessions on the pretext of checking the details only to tell in the end that it is being processed and we'll get a call from service center which never comes. I regret buying this product. The person for whom this TV was bought has lost interest. So it's a sheer waste of money.",1

Here is my whole experience or rather the nightmare.
I bought the TV, It has brightness issues. The TV screen is dull even at max brightness. I reported the same to AMAZON. They arranged a tech visit for 4th Aug which never happened, wasted whole day for that visit. They rearranged it for 6th, the tech came and saw the issue they agreed, restarted updated the TV, still the issue was there. I enquired do they agree that issue is there they said Yes. Same evening I called customer support and got the Info that in their system the issue has been updated by the tech firm as resolved. I was dejected and felt cheated. After many hours of calls I was able to get my call transferred to the managers but both the times AMAZON disconnected my call. They kept on sending me messages for feedback. In their system the first visit resolved the issue. One of the customer care executives told me I was supposed to get the report in written from the tech which they did not gave me and did not tell me about. Don't buy this product and even if you want to buy from Flipkart. Samsung and Amazon has degraded their quality. Beware of tech company QDIGI they are the ones responsible for tech visits, read their reviews and you will know. And whats funny is Amzon is still letting them work.",1

Yes, it doesn't support play store, but most popular streaming services are supported on it like,
HOTSTAR, HOICHOI, NETFLIX, PRIME VIDEO, SONY LIV, ZEE5, APPLE TV, YOUTUBE so it was more than enough for me. The Audio clarity and loudness is exceptional for a TV at this budget price.",5

19427,535,Very nice tv low price,4
19428,536,"I should have gone for Panasonic brand. Yes, Panasonic does not have great sound but picture quality of Panasonic is quite closer to Sony.
Well, this product doesn't match with picture quality of Panasonic Tv which does not even have HDR capabilities. Tizen is no match for Android or Apple Tvos or Fire TV. They are all way better. But you will get used to Tizen, so that shouldn't be a problem for young people. But older people are going to have a tough time to get around.
Bezels are quite larger which makes viewing experience too bad(less immersive).
Based on my experience Sony> Panasonic> Samsung.",3
19429,537,"We did not find OTTs like ZEE5 or SonyLIV even when it was mentioned in the features list.
Also the installation took more than a week. The company technician took a week to get the table stand (the tv comes with a wall-mounting kit but we required a table stand) and no demo was given by him either.",2

19432,540,"I am writing this review after using this product for couple of days.. delivery and installation was on time but the guy who visited to install the TV, didnt provided me the wall mount.. he said this particular tv model doesn't include wall mount..

If I talk about this product. Then this tv has amazing sound output, u don't need extra speaker... Very easy to operate, it have all mentioned smart features in it.

If I talk about picture quality then it really disappoints you.. earlier I was using 32 inch lg tv and picture quality was much much better than this one... If you are very particular about picture quality then definitely I will not suggest you this samsung tv",3

Within 3 month the motherboard of the TV is failed. Luckily the TV is under warranty, hence it would be replaced free of cost otherwise i ahad to bear additional 6K cost.
Two learnings
Buy TV from companies who have good service reputation
Buy additional warranty, specifically for smart TV",2

19711,819,I bought this tv based on the fact that it has very good reviews. Luckily i got an exception from Amazon and could return. I won‚Äôt write the reason for getting the exception here. However its very likely you will not like this tv cause it misses the number one factor for a tv that is good picture quality and therefore all the other smart features don‚Äôt matter. Its more like a computer monitor. Check it out in some showroom before ordering it else you maybe left with a baggage.,1

Samsung service engineer told that we are helpless and the issue doesn't come under warranty. I don't know why they are giving waranty and insurance for that. While switching on tv only lines and cracks are appearing but there is physical damage done to tv. Amazon should look into this issue otherwise you will lost valuable customers. Already you are having quality issues of products and cases also going on right. If you people still ignore this issue, you lost valuable customers. I'm having prime membership from several years and my family members also using this with trust. If my issue not solved then this is my last item through this app. I spent lot of money in Amazon with trust but no response from yours side and samsung side.

19871,979,Good quality product. Bought it for the Samsung name but it doesn't have option for important apps like Discovery+ or MX Player and few others. That alone is a big let down. Would not have bought this if I had known earlier. The app store is full of apps related to quran/Islamic studies.

By the way to customer service is absolute trash. They treat you like you owe them a lot of money.

20306,1414,Good,5
20307,1415,I think that Samsung needs to review their quality control. The table stand supplied with the TV does not fit and therefore I was not able to use the product. The assigned technician from Samsung refused to come for service and amazon insisted on a job sheet from the technician to return the product. They need 48 hours to solve this issue. I have paid for a product and need to wait for an extra 48-72 hours to return a non working product. This is not good service to a privileged customer since 2014. I think that Amazon needs to review its customer service for such defective products and should be made to give compensation for the loss of time and betrayal of trust,1
